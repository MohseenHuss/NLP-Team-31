The visitors, with Mario Balotelli in their ranks, will seek to reimpose their quality after losing at Manchester City on Monday.

David de Gea will not play because he is distracted by Real Madrid’s interest and to replace his No1 the manager has only the untested Sam Johnstone or Sergio Romero. Bastian Schweinsteiger, his headline central midfield summer signing, is not match-fit and, if Wayne Rooney was to suffer injury, Van Gaal has only Javier Hernández or James Wilson to replace his central striker. Given the £230m investment the manager has overseen in his 12 months in charge United should still defeat Tottenham.

However it is 22 years since their last win at the ground, so they will still be braced for an awkward afternoon. José Mourinho has had a fortnight to stew over the loss at Stoke, a third league defeat in succession, which he watched from the team’s hotel. Still backed by the club’s hierarchy, who have promised to be even more supportive, he will be back on the touchline on Saturday seeking a reaction and a step forward on the road to recovery.

Can he use it to somehow secure a top-four finish? Newcastle fans must trust this is not Rafael Benítez’s Tyneside swansong. The negotiations between their widely coveted manager and Mike Ashley over extending a contract that has only a year to run remain delicate. Expect the Gallowgate End to, not for the first time, repeatedly sing “Rafa Benítez, we want you to stay.” Chelsea meanwhile are monitoring Newcastle’s much improved centre-half Jamaal Lascelles. He could be key to Benítez’s team ending a run of four straight defeats as they struggle to retain their grip on 10th place.

Mark Hughes would give his prospects of staying an added boost with a return against the club who sacked him in 2009 and he has urged Saints to make a quick decision for next season. “It’s a well-run club, good club, and a good opportunity for whoever gets it,” said Hughes who arrived only in March. If City win they will set more records, however, for the most away wins in a Premier League season with 16, and the most points on the road, 50. “In the last few weeks these numbers have helped us keep focus,” said Guardiola, whose players secured the title on 15 April.
