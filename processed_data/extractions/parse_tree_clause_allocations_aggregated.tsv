In October, Gus Poyet presided over his first game as Sunderland manager at Swansea . It was a 4-0 defeat and left his new team with one point from eight games. Seven months on Poyet has choreographed a miraculous escape from relegation and the Stadium of Light is preparing to party. With Garry Monk newly confirmed as Swansea's manager the visitors should be in similarly light-hearted mood. Expect some good passing and maybe a goal or two from Wilfried Bony or Connor Wickham.

The visitors, with Mario Balotelli in their ranks, will seek to reimpose their quality after losing at Manchester City on Monday.

Burnley should give a debut to Johann Berg Gudmundsson but he is their only outfield signing so far – Aston Villa’s Ashley Westwood may follow – and there are concerns that last season’s Championship winners are thin on numbers and quality. Swansea must adjust to losing Ashley Williams and André Ayew in quick succession and the match comes too soon for record signing Borja Bastón. Both squads should look stronger at the month’s end but a negative start could be hard to claw back.

Six points from seven games is a slightly disappointing return for Aitor Karanka who needs more from the currently under-achieving Gaston Ramírez and can only hope Álvaro Negredo rediscovers his scoring touch. In contrast, Watford’s Troy Deeney has scored three times in the last four games and Walter Mazzarri has challenged his centre forward to break into the England team.

Mauricio Pochettino wants to give the old place the send-off it deserves, with what would be a 17th consecutive win in all competitions. Tottenham are unbeaten at the Lane this season and José Mourinho has made it plain that Manchester United’s priority is the Europa League.

No matter; this remains an enticing, and intriguing, fixture, particularly as Spurs will presumably want revenge for their 5-1 thrashing here in May 2016. Given the chasm in quality between the two squads few are respecting a repeat of that scoreline; indeed Benítez would probably be happy with a point in front of another full house.

Last week’s win against Bournemouth was only their second in 10 league games but it gave the fans hope and Mark Hughes will be looking to capitalise on that during the trip to Goodison, where the atmosphere has been eerily quiet of late. Sam Allardyce, like Hughes another merry-go-round perennial to take over in the dugout since Saints defeated Everton 4-1 in October’s reverse fixture, reckons he has won “the hearts and minds” of the Everton majority with their home performances and insists the dissenters are a vocal minority. Some were evident when Everton won their last home game, against Newcastle, with their only shot on target, but many were more so during the 2-0 win at Huddersfield later that week. With Allardyce already talking about his plans for the close season, some may even welcome the chance to clear their throats and get the banners out if Hughes produces the away win Saints crave.
