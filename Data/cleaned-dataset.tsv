The Capital One Cup final against Manchester City looms next weekend – Sunderland's first major final for 22 years – and there is also an FA Cup quarter-final at Brighton or Hull. Yet nothing matters more than Premier League survival and, with his team in the relegation zone, Poyet is desperate for a tonic. Arsenal want a response to the Champions League loss against Bayern Munich. David Hytner	13/14

John Terry is back after a muscle injury and Gary Cahill is in contention despite a thigh problem. For Everton, Romelu Lukaku is ineligible against his parent club, while Steven Naismith will play some part after a head injury. Conor Davies	13/14

Crystal Palace have been excellent at Selhurst Park since Tony Pulis's arrival, winning five of their seven home matches under the former Stoke City manager. Although Palace remain two points above the bottom three, they will fancy their chances of giving David Moyes another headache. United have found it difficult at this ground in the past.

Despite the midweek loss to Barcelona in the Champions League, Pellegrini is confident his players will not be affected so Stoke may be in for a torrid time at the Etihad, where only Chelsea have taken any points from the home side.

We will see this afternoon whether that worked but with only one point from the last six games, they need an instant response. West Bromwich, however, have the next worst recent run of form with three points from 18. Alan Smith	13/14

Mauricio Pochettino's team, meanwhile, are unbeaten in six league games and will be looking to win a third consecutive away game for the first time in the top flight – after victories at Fulham and Hull.

Last weekend's FA Cup defeat to Everton was Swansea's first defeat in four matches under Monk. They have rediscovered their cohesion and energy in recent weeks but will need to be on peak form to withstand a Liverpool team smarting from their cup exit at Arsenal and sensing a title challenge under the former Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers.

Paul Lambert can only trust it has done them more good than last month's trip to Abu Dhabi did Newcastle. Since returning, Alan Pardew's team have failed to score a goal while conceding 10 in their last three games. With only one win in nine matches and lacking a home victory since Boxing Day, Pardew is under pressure. ""Newcastle's crowd can become edgy,"" said Lambert.

Tim Sherwood will welcome back Emmanuel Adebayor and Hugo Lloris after they were rested against Dnipro on Thursday as Spurs look to maintain their top-four push. Conor Davies	13/14

Relations have been strained ever since Paul Lambert left Norwich for Villa in 2012 and time has not been much of a healer. A game full of subplots – Wes Hoolahan wanted to join Villa from Norwich in January while Grant Holt, who scored prolifically during his time at Carrow Road, is likely to be among the Villa substitutes – carries extra significance because both clubs are desperate for points to climb clear of the relegation scrap.

Fulham's new manager, Felix Magath, reckons there is more pressure on Cardiff but, winless since January, they need to improve before it's too late. Alan Smith	13/14

The point earned at home to Everton remains their only reward in 12 games against the teams from Southampton up and, with Marouane Chamakh hamstrung, a lot will depend upon Glenn Murray hitting the ground running. The Saints will be buoyed by the international recognition gained by their players in midweek, though that may yet prove to have disrupted their preparations. Dominic Fifield	13/14

Wes Hoolahan made only his sixth start of the season and scored within three minutes against Aston Villa last week so he should get the nod against a Stoke team minus Charlie Adam, who is banned for a stamp on Olivier Giroud. Mark Hughes' team are not safe either and defeat would see them overtaken by Norwich. Alan Smith	13/14

On Friday he spoke of how they are ahead of schedule but refuses to acknowledge that with a seven-point lead heading into this weekend, Chelsea are one of the favourites for the title. Win against Villa, who have lost seven of their eight home games to teams in the top 10, and he must publicly recognise their credentials. Alan Smith	13/14

The German was plunged into a mess and his three games in charge have yet to produce any evidence that he can tidy it up. Fulham's best hope of getting their first win league win since New Year's Day could lie in the attitude of their opponents, but, after going through an indifferent spell, Newcastle have won their last two matches and seem to have their heads in the right places again.

Now, with the League Cup already safely secured, they have only the Premier League to focus on. It will be intriguing to see how they bounce back following the defeats to Wigan and Barcelona but Hull will look to use the momentum gained from their FA Cup run to move closer to safety.

But they must now build on that because, with Sunderland holding two games in hand, Mel's team are by no stretch of the imagination safe. Hull, with only one win in their past eight home league games, could still be dragged into the fight for survival, despite sitting 14th. West Brom would leapfrog Steve Bruce's team with a win, outlining how tightly bunched the bottom half of the table is. Alan Smith	13/14

Wednesday's victory over Olympiakos in the Champions League has lifted the gloom for David Moyes after last Sunday's humiliation at home to Liverpool, although United will have to be at their best at Upton Park, a ground where they have often come unstuck. The doubts will return if United lose to West Ham, who are not quite clear of the relegation battle just yet.

Injuries have hit and the team's confidence is fragile while they encounter a City side fresh from their humbling of Manchester United and who remain as most people's title favourites. Arsène Wenger has them down as the side to beat. Arsenal's manager might have to temper his natural instinct to get on to the front foot – City bite.

With Liverpool and Manchester City breathing down their necks, Chelsea can ill afford to slip up against a team without a win in five matches.

The Scot concedes he needs to win matches so who knows what might occur if United go down to Villa in what would be a seventh home league defeat. That would be a club record in the Premier League era, beating the mark set just on Tuesday evening when City beat Moyes's side 3-0 and Sir Alex Ferguson was abused by some supporters.

Andre Marriner will be hoping for a quiet afternoon after his blunder during Chelsea's win over Arsenal last week and will be glad that Alan Pardew, whose stadium ban is over, is not allowed on the touchline yet. Newcastle's manager is looking forward to giving his team-talk after three matches away. But both sides are safe in mid-table, so this is likely to be a low-pressure affair. Jacob Steinberg	13/14

Despite being without a win in their last six league games, Swansea will have been buoyed by the late point they earned at Arsenal on Tuesday.

The tension surrounding Sunderland's visit on Wednesday did not stop a seventh consecutive win and memories of December's 5-0 thrashing of Tottenham, Liverpool's biggest ever win at White Hart Lane, offer assurance.

Still, three points here would put Manuel Pellegrini's team a point behind Liverpool with the top two set to collide next weekend.

While Alan Pardew – who admits he is struggling to motivate Newcastle's players – aims to compensate for last week's disappointing defeat at Southampton, David Moyes must balance the desire for points against potential European glory. With injuries depriving Pardew of several key individuals including Loïc Rémy, it will be interesting to see who he rests ahead of the Manchester United's decisive Champions League trip to Bayern Munich.

Six points clear of the drop, a win over an increasingly desperate West Brom would put them in a good position. Norwich's home form is strong, with an unbeaten run stretching back to December, while West Brom's only win under Pepe Mel came on the road. Defeat for Albion will increase their fears.

Victory over Arsenal would move the Blues, who have won their past five league matches, a point behind them with a game in hand and a top-four finish would be within touching distance.

Upton Park has been a graveyard for potential champions in the past and for Liverpool the fear must be that they will come unstuck at the hands of two of their former players, Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing.

Already closing in on their best Premier League finish, a win would move Stoke to within three points of Alan Pardew's troubled team. Alan Smith	13/14

Easy to write, harder to accomplish. The visit of Manchester City presents arguably the toughest assignment left for Brendan Rodgers' side, although Chelsea also await, and victory at a seething Anfield would leave Manuel Pellegrini's side requiring a slip-up. City, however, with Sergio Agüero fit again, can wrestle control of the title should they inflict a first home defeat on Liverpool since September. Andy Hunter	13/14

The club's decision to suspend Ian Culverhouse, the assistant manager, and Gary Karsa, the head of football operations, on the back of a fourth successive defeat has left them in a state of turmoil. It is 13 years since Villa lost five league games on the spin. The visitors are also struggling, having lost three of their last four. Something has to give. Stuart James	13/14

José Mourinho will balance his selection with the Champions League semi-finals to come and next weekend's trip to Liverpool stretching his squad's resources. Sunderland must seek to repeat their resounding 3-0 success of November 2010 in these parts, but they did eliminate a strong Chelsea team from the League Cup in December.

If the St James' Park crowd would probably not forgive Alan Pardew for a fifth straight defeat, Swansea seem to have forgotten that their mantra is supposed to be all about passing to each other rather than infighting. If Garry Monk's side can retain possession for prolonged periods Newcastle fans are likely to be turn edgy so Pardew may persist with a back five and must pray the returning France striker Loïc Rémy can alter the narrative.

The scrutiny that has been placed on the run-in has long since reached head-wrecking levels and, realistically, Fulham know that they need to win at home to Hull and Crystal Palace.

They are a point behind fourth-placed Arsenal but they cannot afford a slip-up against Southampton, who will be encouraged by the news that Roberto Martinez's side will be without their first-choice centre-backs, Sylvain Distin and Phil Jagielka, through injury; Rickie Lambert will hope to capitalise on any unfamiliarity between Antolín Alcaraz and John Stones.

A victory for Stoke will give them a first of five successive Premier League home wins, a record that the club and the manager, Mark Hughes, wholly deserve.

Only two wins better than bottom-placed Sunderland and without an away triumph since New Year's Day, Paul Lambert's team face a tough job against a Swansea side boosted by last Saturday's win at Newcastle.

West Brom are looking pretty desperate, teetering on the edge of the drop zone, and their manager, Pepe Mel, has pinpointed this game as the one where three points must be taken.

Their hosts have won five top-flight games in succession for the first time in 22 years, their safety assured and the manager, Tony Pulis, now urging his team on to a top-half finish. City, without David Silva and Jesús Navas, will be grateful for Yaya Touré's potential return in midfield as they seek to prolong the title race.

Alan Pardew's side have been ensconced in mid-table safety for so long that all momentum has been drained.

The £27.5m Marouane Fellaini will be hoping to return to the squad, having missed out against Norwich City last week. Jamie Jackson	13/14

Their failure to hold on to that lead means that they now depend on other results as well as their own, but winning on Saturday could put them back in control of their own destiny.

Goodison Park has brought City little reward for a decade and has witnessed only two home league defeats this season, although injuries and the ineligibility of Gareth Barry against his parent club limits Roberto Martínez's options. With Aston Villa and West Ham to follow at home, this promises to be the biggest obstacle to a second title in three seasons for City. Andy Hunter	13/14

There can be no lingering fallout from the damaging defeat to Chelsea, and Crystal Palace, safe in mid-table, would appear timely opposition. Yet Liverpool have not won on their last four visits to Palace, a sequence stretching back to December 1997, and the hosts will seek to end their own home campaign on a high. An awkward evening awaits. Dominic Fifield	13/14

That was the latter's last game in charge, the fifth of seven matches lost in succession. Yet Tony Pulis has steered the Eagles to a remarkable 11th place with the turmoil transferred to Craven Cottage. The hosts, now on their third manager of term, bid farewell to the top flight after 13 seasons with a summer of change ahead: the hope is their talented youngsters from an excellent academy are given opportunities on the final day to promise of an immediate return.

Arsenal 1989, Istanbul 2005 and Crystanbul – as Monday's three-goal collapse at Selhurst Park has become known – all ensure Anfield will not concede the title to Manchester City unless or until it is a mathematical certainty. To be saying that before the final game of the season underlines what a campaign this has been under Brendan Rodgers.

For the first time this campaign the Chilean has everyone fit so expect his first-choice team to be assembled at the Etihad and, if Yaya Touré, David Silva, Sergio Agüero and company score early, this could turn into a party that will still be going on Monday morning.

Will Ryan Giggs round off his brief reign with a victory? Will young James Wilson produce a display as superb as his midweek debut?

In October, Gus Poyet presided over his first game as Sunderland manager at Swansea . It was a 4-0 defeat and left his new team with one point from eight games. Seven months on Poyet has choreographed a miraculous escape from relegation and the Stadium of Light is preparing to party. With Garry Monk newly confirmed as Swansea's manager the visitors should be in similarly light-hearted mood. Expect some good passing and maybe a goal or two from Wilfried Bony or Connor Wickham.

The goalscorer in that 1-0 win, Dejan Lovren, joined the summer exodus from St Mary’s to Liverpool and is the only former Saint likely to start against his old club with Adam Lallana suffering from a knee injury and Rickie Lambert, who has scored against all his ex-teams, set for the substitutes’ bench.

Nigel Pearson will be hoping that his Leicester side – beaten only four times away from home in the league last season – can present more of a challenge at Stamford Bridge this afternoon, otherwise it could be another easy three points for Chelsea.

They have not been able to find a replacement for Tony Pulis, their sporting director has left, and Keith Millen will be in caretaker charge again. Yet this is a good opportunity for Palace to secure their first win. They were solid at Selhurst Park last season and did the double over West Ham, who are under pressure after last week’s defeat to Tottenham. Sam Allardyce needs a result. Jacob Steinberg	14/15

Arsenal were outplayed and Wenger outthought in a 3-0 defeat at Everton in April, with Romelu Lukaku starring for Roberto Martínez’s side. Goodison will be keen for a repeat from the £28m striker after a subdued opening game at Leicester City. Andy Hunter	14/15

Georgios Samaras, however, will not be available in time for kick-off. Ronald Koeman, who is also dealing with a much changed forward lineup, will want Southampton to build on their solid but fruitless opening display against Liverpool. Graham Searles	14/15

Swansea’s confidence is reflected by their choice to stick with last week’s winning line-up. Burnley also name an unchanged line-up in their search for their first points of the season. New Swansea signing Federico Fernández is still waiting for international clearance and is unlikely to make his debut. Graham Searles	14/15

The Hull manager is expected to make changes to the side that lost 1-0 at Lokeren on Thursday but with Yannick Sagbo banned and Robert Snodgrass injured, he may be stretching his already small squad to the limit. Stoke, conversely, are fully rested and almost no injury concerns – it could be a good day at the KC Stadium for Mark Hughes. Rich Flower	14/15

Not content with defeating David Moyes’s side in last season’s Capital One Cup semi-final, Gus Poyet’s players upset Ryan Giggs’s caretakership with a springtime league win at Old Trafford. Even so, Vito Mannone, the home goalkeeper, admits he will be “more happy” if his one time Arsenal team-mate Robin van Persie does not start in attack for the visitors. Louise Taylor	14/15

His former player Danny Rose has led the calls for the 67-year-old to be granted “a good reception”, though QPR will hope Spurs are sluggish after their Europa League qualifying exploits in Cyprus on Thursday. It is 20 years since Rangers last triumphed across the capital at Spurs. Their new signings, Mauricio Isla and Leroy Fer, should feature. Dominic Fifield	14/15

As the deal for Mario Balotelli was not done in time for the forward to be available for Liverpool, Manchester City must surely fancy their chances of finishing Monday evening with all three points, especially as only Alvaro Negredo and Eliaquim Mangala are unavailable to Manuel Pellegrini. Jamie Jackson	14/15

After dropping five of the first six points on offer and being beaten 4-0 by MK Dons in the Capital One Cup, the Louis van Gaal’s team are yet enjoy to victory. Three points at Turf Moor would correct this and help rebuild “smashed” confidence yet Burnley have happy memories of winning the corresponding match the last time they were in the Premier League. If Ángel di María features, the tight compact ground will provide a memorable backdrop to the debut of British football’s most expensive player. Jamie Jackson	14/15

After two draws so far, both a consequence of conceding late goals, he will be hoping for a repeat with the ex-Chelsea strikers Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto’o in his ranks but this is a far more potent and creative José Mourinho side than the one that arrived at Goodison Park for Eto’o’s debut 12 months ago.

Even if Agüero is not fully fit, Manuel Pellegrini can still call upon Stevan Jovetic, scorer of two goals against Liverpool on Monday, and Edin Dzeko. Stoke also have strength in depth and Victor Moses, signed by Mark Hughes on loan from Chelsea this week, is expected to be on the bench. Rich Flower	14/15

Much improved in midfield – where all eyes will be on Jack Colback in the wake of his England call-up – the home side still look lightweight in attack and await their first league goal of the season. Meanwhile Pardew, once a Palace midfielder, has promised to refrain from engagement in touchline disputes with his feisty counterpart. Louise Taylor	14/15

Several of them are expected to return when the top flight reconvenes on 13 September but for now the West Ham manager will have to make the best of what he has against Southampton. The visitors are missing Jay Rodriguez but most of the rest of their new-look squad are available. Rich Flower	14/15

Villa were defeated by lower-league opponents yet again, when they lost to Leyton Orient in the Capital One Cup, while Hull’s European campaign came to an abrupt end after losing on away goals. Villa badly need some firepower, after registering only one shot on goal in the league so far. As for Hull, Michael Dawson, newly signed from Tottenham, should make his debut. Stuart James	14/15

How Arsène Wenger must wish that he could call on the Dutchman now. With Olivier Giroud facing a long period out, Wenger’s belief that Arsenal are not light up front will come under scrutiny on an afternoon when Esteban Cambiasso could make his debut for Leicester. The Foxes have not beaten Arsenal in the Premier League since 1994. Stuart James	14/15

Liverpool ran riot at White Hart Lane with Luis Suárez irrepressible, and then blitzed them in the return to the tune of a 9-0 aggregate scoreline. Mauricio Pochettino’s Spurs, with a perfect record to date under the Argentinian, will provide a sterner test and, if they click into their upbeat rhythm, could leave Liverpool’s start to the campaign feeling stodgy. The visitors, with Mario Balotelli in their ranks, will seek to reimpose their quality after losing at Manchester City on Monday. Dominic Fifield	14/15

For both clubs it is the precursor to big midweek Champions League ties in Germany while for City, the kicker at the end of the week is provided by the visit of Chelsea. Victory in the early kick-off would represent a tonic, particularly, one feels, for Arsenal, whose record against top-four finishers in the last few seasons has been poor. David Hytner	14/15

The only teams with perfect Premier League records go head to head at Stamford Bridge and points will be shed for the first time. Chelsea may still prefer to rest Diego Costa, the division's player of the month, with one eye on a suspect hamstring and the other on Wednesday's visit of Schalke. The Welsh club, under the elite's manager of the month, have not won a league game in this corner of south-west London since 1925, though they will be sustained by the League Cup semi-final first leg win here in 2013. Such is their current confidence, they will be convinced they are capable of a repeat. Dominic Fifield	14/15

Warnock, who will need no introduction to the Selhurst Park crowd, will hope that Palace have a spring in their step after their dramatic draw against Newcastle United, but they are still seeking their first win of the season. However Burnley, who secured a creditable draw against Manchester United in their last match, will not roll over. Jacob Steinberg	14/15

Sturridge will be missing against the unbeaten Villa because of injury suffered with England but that leaves centre stage clear for Mario Balotelli on his home debut. Adam Lallana and Lazar Markovic are also pressing for inclusion as Liverpool look to build on their impressive dismantling of Spurs last time out.Andy Hunter	14/15

Morgan Schneiderlin scored twice and Koeman will definitely be looking for more of the same from the Frenchman. Graham Searles	14/15

Italy's Emmanuel Giaccherini is similarly anxious to emphasise that he is no longer Sunderland's forgotten man but Mauricio Pochettino will look to outwit a fellow South American manager en route to seeing his Tottenham team atone for their 3-0 home defeat to Liverpool a fortnight ago.

Alan Irvine will also be spurred on by Everton's crippling defensive frailties that have led the side to concede ten goals in their opening three games.

These are the pressing issues for the Dutchman as a Queens Park Rangers containing Rio Ferdinand roll into an Old Trafford that has become the Theatre of Nightmares rather than its more famous moniker.This could be the start of a star-studded United era as Radamel Falcao, Angel Di Maria, Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata all vie for a starting berth in Van Gaal’s XI. United, surely, cannot fail to win again, can they? Jamie Jackson	14/15

Steve Bruce will be looking to repeat his side's 1-0 home victory last season over West Ham who also start a new loan signing in Alex Song. Sam Allardyce will want Song to recreate the performances that led Barcelona to sign him from Arsenal in 2012. Graham Searles	14/15

They sit in second behind Chelsea and despite having registered only six shots on target will fancy their chances of causing another upset. They have kept a clean sheet in three of their four games to date – the same cannot be said for Arsenal who have conceded a headed goal in all four games and may also be suffering from a Champions League hangover coming into this.

Sean Dyche will be buoyed by the knowledge that Sunderland are one of three sides yet to keep a clean sheet. Three of their four games have been 1-1 at half-time but they have lost only once in their last five road trips. Alan Smith	14/15

Home fans are expected to demand their manager’s head but Pardew – who accuses his detractors of “mass hysteria” – has resolved to stand firm. Despite his loan from Newcastle dictating he cannot play here, Hatem Ben Arfa will be in the away dugout with his presence promising to add spice to a match Bruce may regard as an audition.

QPR, meanwhile, need to recover from last week’s drubbing at Manchester United and show signs that they really are much better off than when Hughes was in charge of them.

Southampton won both games last season to nil and will be looking to win three games on the spin for only the third time since returning to the top flight. Swansea have the most settled side in the league – Garry Monk has used only 16 players – but will need Gylfi Sigurdsson, who has four assists already to his name, to be on form if they are to maintain their 100% home record.

Defeat to Aston Villa was particularly painful for the Merseyside club, who will be keen to get back to winning ways against a West Ham side who have lost each of their last three home fixtures.

The Everton manager named an unchanged side for Thursday’s defeat of Wolfsburg but with Samuel Eto’o impressing as a substitute, Darron Gibson fit again plus difficult trips to Swansea City and Liverpool to come next week, he may not opt for tried-and-trusted again.

Leonardo Ulloa has been in good form for Nigel Pearson’s team and having held Arsenal to a draw at home will be hopeful they can also tame Louis van Gaal’s side. Alan Smith	14/15

And while Diego Costa’s hamstrings remain a worry, José Mourinho will be quietly confident of repeating last year’s result at the Etihad, where they defended brilliantly on the way to a 1-0 win. City have yet to fully flex their muscles despite drawing at Arsenal. Alan Smith	14/15

Paul Lambert’s squad had been affected by a virus before that first loss of the season and his players will arrive recovered, though competing with Chelsea, with Diego Costa fit and starting, will provide its own problems. The leaders have lost one league game at home to Villa in 12 years. They will be confident of remaining clear of the pack. Dominic Fifield	14/15

Yet both managers will know that it is results in matches like these that will go a long way to defining their seasons. Paul Chronnell	14/15

But their manager, Steve Bruce, claimed this week, after their Capital One Cup defeat against West Brom, that they are “really close to having a really good team”. They will certainly back up that statement if they beat Manchester City, who are looking for their first league win of this month. Conrad Leach	14/15

An open, error-prone opponent is just what Liverpool need as they look to rediscover last season’s form but much will depend on Daniel Sturridge’s fitness and Raheem Sterling’s energy levels after his 120-minute outing against Middlesbrough on Tuesday. The 223rd Merseyside derby is one neither team can afford to lose. Andy Hunter	14/15

Five points from five games, two defeats and only one win is the count from Manchester United’s dismal start. Nine is the tally of players injured with a 10th, Tyler Blackett, suspended. And 3-1 was the scoreline when West Ham dismantled Liverpool last time out. Not for the first time – and probably not the last – this term, Van Gaal and his band need a victory desperately so the number three can again be enjoyed. Jamie Jackson	14/15

Swansea and Aston Villa have been there this season and then blinked in the headlights. Southampton, however, will fancy their chances of staying close to Chelsea. Ronald Koeman’s side won at Arsenal in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday and have conceded only three league goals while QPR have not scored away from home this season. Conrad Leach	14/15

Last Sunday’s 1-0 win at Tottenham lifted Albion but they have only three league goals so far. Burnley’s last three games have ended 0-0; the odds on another will not be generous.

Cissé’s two goals against Hull last Saturday may have saved the Newcastle manager’s job – at least for now – but Pardew might have been under a lot less pressure if the Senegal striker had contributed more than 21 minutes of playing time so far this season. Stoke, usually so solid at the Britannia Stadium, have lost both their home league games and could be vulnerable. Rich Flower	14/15

Warnock will be keen to continue this run of form by repeating last season’s away win.

Nigel Pearson will hope that their in-form new striker Ulloa can again provide the difference as he has done so often this season.

Maybe the Liverpool boss will regret not picking up Danny Welbeck instead.

This leaves Gus Poyet’s side doubly anxious to atone for Stoke’s recent 2-1 League Cup win on Wearside but whatever happens Mark Hughes is likely to cast covetous glances at Lee Cattermole. Poyet says persuading his board not to sell Sunderland’s enforcer to Stoke last January ranks as his best piece of transfer business. Louise Taylor	14/15

This team were thrashed 6-0 in the corresponding fixture back in March in the manager’s 1,000th game in charge, and Arsène Wenger has yet to defeat a José Mourinho side in 11 previous meetings. This is a contest between the division’s two remaining unbeaten teams: it would be a timely occasion for Wenger to break that duck. Dominic Fifield	14/15

Wayne Rooney misses the outing as the opening match of his three-game suspension, so Juan Mata is in line to take the captain’s No10 berth. Everton returned to these shores at 3am on Friday from their Europa League trip to Russia’s FK Krasnodar so Roberto Martínez will hope his team are not too tired after the journey.

But Pochettino will welcome his former team who are sitting second in the table, five points better off than Tottenham. Moreover, they are in a tactical groove under Ronald Koeman as Pochettino battles to instil his philosophy at White Hart Lane. It could be an uncomfortable afternoon for the Argentinian.

Rangers, Redknapp admits, “need to tighten up” but, with the second worst goalscoring record in the league, they must find a few more goals too.

Hull will be buoyed by Arsène Wenger’s woes and will want to build on their first home win of the season in their last outing.

Combine that with West Ham’s uncharacteristically sloppy defending and surprisingly incisive attacking thus far this season and there should be goals. So put your money on a 0-0 draw.

But, if statistics are anything to go by, there are plenty of other teams that Roberto Martínez would rather face: last season’s 2-1 win was the first time that Everton have beaten Villa at Goodison Park in the top flight since March 2006.

Nigel Pearson, who served as assistant manager at St James’ Park under Sam Allardyce, will be anxious to exploit any edginess among those wearing black and white as he seeks to extend Leicester’s promising start to Premier League life.

The 8-0 win over Sunderland was the most eye-catching result of the season so far but it is unlikely that there is going to be a repeat against Stoke City, who should provide a sturdier test for Ronald Koeman’s side.

Atonement is demanded but Poyet’s team could probably have done without a visit from Arsenal at this delicate juncture. At least a mixture of injuries and Jack Wilshere’s suspension means Arsène Wenger is without nine first-teamers including Mesut Özil, Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott.

City were guilty of slipping into slackness in the second half of their Champions League clash with CSKA Moscow in midweek, and West Ham are as capable as the Russians of punishing them if they relapse. West Ham’s defence has been excellent all season but the in-form Sergio Agüero will give them their biggest test; though in Diafra Sakho and Enner Valenica, the Hammers have top strikers of their own. A fascinating contest is in store. Paul Doyle	14/15

Burnley have scored only five goals in nine league games and they are likely to adopt a familiar defensive approach, in order to retain a puncher’s chance.

Liverpool’s display at the Bernabéu has been subject to Malcolm Tucker-esque spin since Tuesday, but the fact remains they require a vast improvement to inflict defeat on Chelsea, themselves in need of a jolt after their levels dropped against QPR and Maribor.

The manager was in pugnacious mood on Friday yet injuries to Jonny Evans, Marcos Rojo and Phil Jones plus Chris Smalling’s suspension means Michael Carrick may be used as a stop-gap central defender. Neil Warnock’s side are bound to make life awkward, too. Jamie Jackson	14/15

Manuel Pellegrini’s side are all but out of the Champions League and, despite victory in the Manchester derby, are struggling domestically. Queens Park Rangers need to be defeated but their display at Chelsea suggests this will be a test for the champions. Sachin Nakrani	14/15

Not the ideal time to be visiting the Premier League’s tightest defence then, but at least Leicester could start striker Leonardo Ulloa, who has recovered from the niggle that hampered him last week. That, however, is unlikely to be enough to disrupt Southampton’s serene progress up the league. Paul Doyle	14/15

But with West Ham riding high and dreaming of Europe, and Aston Villa having lost six on the spin, Sam Allardyce has had to call for focus. Christian Benteke is suspended and Villa have scored only five goals all season. They are desperate for any sort of foothold. David Hytner	14/15

Can Everton recover from their Thursday night Europa League exertions in time to win away? Might Gus Poyet’s side struggle in the absence of Patrick van Aanholt, their only recognised left-back? Is Jack Rodwell ready to remind Everton how much they are missing him after a disappointing start on Wearside following his £10m summer move from Manchester City? But will Rodwell even start?

Arsenal travel to Wales eager to get back on track after that chastening experience against Anderlecht in midweek, when they surrendered a 3-0 lead, prompting Paul Merson to describe his former club as “tactically clueless”. With Mathieu Debuchy, Laurent Koscielny and Mikel Arteta sidelined, Swansea may fancy their chances of inflicting some more pain on Arsène Wenger and his players, especially with Wilfried Bony in form. The striker is set to sign a new deal on the eve of this game. David Hytner	14/15

Having racked up three wins since, with Harry Kane a scorer in each game and looking increasingly like White Hart Lane’s knight in shining armour, the clamour for the youngster to start in the Premier League is surely irresistible. Stoke have won once in the last month. Amy Lawrence	14/15

Both clubs ought to have strengthened more in defence and, as they lag outside the top four, the search for momentum has been held up. Arsenal have won two of the previous 18 meetings and, as the home team, their need for the win is probably greater. United, though, are also desperate. “You have to look further than the table and at the quality of the players,” Arsène Wenger suggested. “It’ll be a very exciting game.” David Hytner	14/15

Allardyce’s biggest headache is that his star striker, Diafra Sakho, and partner Enner Valencia may both miss out. If they do then Everton’s defence will breathe a sigh of relief as the pair have been instrumental in West Ham’s excellent form this season. Graham Searles	14/15

Leicester entertain Sunderland having lost four of their past five league games in poor fashion. They will need striker Leonardo Ulloa, who has not netted since September, to regain the golden touch that saw him score freely earlier in the season. A Sunderland win will do much to boost morale in Gus Poyet’s side before fixtures against Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool. Yemi Abiade	14/15

Swansea City arrive only three points behind Manchester City so Manuel Pellegrini, who may well be without Vincent Kompany and David Silva, will be wary of Garry Monk’s side.

Much more of this and Tynesiders will soon be singing about “Walking in a Pardew Wonderland”. Even so, Harry Redknapp – who must pray he can somehow emulate his Newcastle counterpart’s extraordinary renaissance – will be heartened by the raft of injuries, primarily in defence, which deprive the home side of some key performers including Fabricio Coloccini.

The visitors have actually won only once at Palace in 20 years but, while their own season has been stodgy, they will confront hosts whose recent form is unrecognisable from that which propelled Tony Pulis’s team to safety last term. One point from five is a miserable return and they could be in tbe bottom three come kick-off. Liverpool will be after revenge. Dominic Fifield	14/15

Ronald Koeman’s side have won 11 of their last 12 matches in all competitions and will arrive at Villa Park second in the table. They are full of confidence. Aston Villa, on the other hand, have picked up one point out of a possible 21 – a goalless draw at Upton Park last time out – and are without three central defenders through injury as well as the suspended Christian Benteke.

As a former Chelsea player, Poyet relished choreographing a 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge in April which ended Mourinho’s run of 77 undefeated home Premier League games during his two stints in charge in west London. As if that was not enough, Poyet’s players also knocked Chelsea out of last season’s League Cup. Can lightning strike thrice? “I’m hoping for an ugly evening with lots of wind and rain,” he says.

Life has rarely been this good and Pardew’s Newcastle will arrive at Upton Park in a confident mood after winning their past five matches. Allardyce reckons that only Chelsea would provide a bigger test at the moment, so he will be pleased to have Stewart Downing available again after he missed West Ham’s defeat at Everton last Saturday.

The visitors will hope to maintain momentum after their narrow victory against Swansea and late midweek triumph over Bayern Munich. Southampton secured a point at Aston Villa last time out but it is a mark of their progress to date this term that even a draw in the west Midlands felt wasteful. Their pedigree will be scrutinised in a tough schedule over the next month. There has been little evidence to date that they will be daunted. Dominic Fifield	14/15

Steve Bruce was relieved after a 1-1 draw with Everton lifted them to 17th but the Tigers are still without a win in seven and a point behind the visitors, West Brom, who have lost their past four putting pressure on Alan Irvine to stop the rot. His side travel to the KC Stadium without the captain, Chris Brunt, who suffered a hamstring injury in their midweek defeat to West Ham. Amy Eustace	14/15

A back-to-basics approach has paid dividends for the Liverpool manager, who may again consider resting Steven Gerrard with a crucial Champions League game against Basel plus Manchester United to come next week. Sunderland have scored only five goals in six league away games this season and last won at Anfield in 1983. Andy Hunter	14/15

The champions’ rousing 4-1 victory at Sunderland in the week was a third consecutive win while Everton’s 1-1 draw with Hull City meant Roberto Martinez’s side have a sole victory in their past five outings. Still, Everton arrive with Ross Barkley in their ranks, a player much admired by City. If is at his best the visitors have a chance. Jamie Jackson	14/15

Even so, St James’ Park regulars have long wondered what might have been had Sir Bobby Robson got his way and succeeded in persuading the Portuguese to go there as his assistant back in the late 1990s. Mourinho and Alan Pardew are friends but Pardew would still relish celebrating Tuesday’s fourth anniversary of his installation as Newcastle manager by ending Chelsea’s unbeaten run.

Harry Redknapp’s team are unbeaten in their past three home matches and they welcome another promoted side to west London after edging a thrilling encounter with Leicester City last Saturday. However Burnley, unbeaten in four matches, are starting to find their feet and they will hope that Danny Ings can inspire them again. Jacob Steinberg	14/15

Even before that Arsenal did not relish trips to the Britannia, where Arsène Wenger has won only once in seven attempts. But this might be a good time to visit, as Stoke are struggling with both injuries and form and have lost their last three leagues games. Nothing would give Stoke fans greater pleasure that run end against Arsenal. Paul Doyle	14/15

Mauricio Pochettino wants to see more sustained evidence that his philosophy is taking root and he will again be without Emmanuel Adebayor, who remains weak after a virus. Crystal Palace have promised to be positive. “If you go into away games thinking a point is good, you tend to lose,” Julián Speroni said. David Hytner	14/15

His side have failed to win since beating Manchester United 5-3 in September. Villa, on the other hand, ended a run of nine games without a win at Selhurst Park on Tuesday. Their 1-0 victory came courtesy of a Christian Benteke strike and Paul Lambert will certainly hope that the forward is soon back to his old, sparkling self. Amy Eustace	14/15

Both clubs acted shrewdly in the summer – there haven’t proved to be too many better bargains than Gylfi Sigurdsson and Alex Song – and will be looking to do so again next month. Paul Chronnell	14/15

They will consider a visit from Manchester United as an opportunity to regain lost momentum, though injuries are starting to test the depth of Ronald Koeman’s squad. Louis van Gaal will have no sympathy on that front given his own list of absentees. United have won four in a row and are upwardly mobile. This test is awkward, but less daunting than it would recently have appeared. Dominic Fifield	14/15

They have beaten Arsenal only once in 17 meetings and Alan Pardew has lost on each of his three visits with the club to the Emirates. The 7-3 defeat in December 2012 was sobering but Newcastle are in confident mood after beating Chelsea and they want another tonic before the Capital One Cup tie at Tottenham and the derby against Sunderland next Sunday.

They will view this game as a chance to recover but Burnley, who saw their four-game unbeaten run ended at QPR last time out, have already shown the requisite battling qualities to stay in the top flight.

Petr Cech will start given the muscular injury sustained by Thibaut Courtois, though that does not suggest weakness. Hull, with one win in 14 matches, arrive fragile if perhaps marginally encouraged by the points taken off Everton and West Brom in their past two fixtures. They have never won at Chelsea. Given they will begin the game below the relegation cut-off, this would be a timely occasion to make history. Dominic Fifield	14/15

Warnock riled Mark Hughes by suggesting he “destroyed” QPR after succeeding him in 2012 and the pair have had a frosty relationship ever since. Paul Doyle	14/15

Nigel Pearson’s side are bottom and struggling for form. Manchester City will be confident after qualifying for the knockout stages of the Champions League.

Should West Ham’s now ultra modern, European challenging manager involve Diego Poyet, the afternoon will assume an unusual feel for his father, Gus. Poyet Sr could do with three points as he strives to rebrand a Sunderland side who, although promising, remain a work in progress. Andy Carroll can expect a hot reception - but Allardyce’s former Newcastle United striker would relish scoring the winner. Louise Taylor	14/15

In Louis van Gaal they now have a manager to believe in and he “welcomes” Brendan Rodgers’ side seeking a six consecutive win. The Liverpool manager is feeling serious heat due to average domestic form and being knocked out of the Champions League and a victory over the auld enemy would be a fair fillip. Jamie Jackson	14/15

Freed from its shackles, Swansea are eighth but need to recover from their damaging defeat at West Ham. Spurs have struggled after Thursday exertions before and the tiring Europa League trip to Turkey will have taken its toll but those excuses are wearing thin. Paul Chronnell	14/15

Everton have not won in three league games and home form is largely responsible for Roberto Martínez’s side falling behind the European hopefuls. Goodison Park has witnessed only two league wins this term but their injury list is clearing and John Stones could return after an ankle injury. Harry Redknapp’s strugglers have lost all seven away games, the worst record in the division. Andy Hunter	14/15

While Paul Lambert has steadied the Villa team since a six-game losing streak, his side will have to improve to have any chance of a positive result. However Christian Benteke could provide them with a glimmer of hope when challenging the perpetually weakened United defence. Graham Searles	14/15

The manager may field José Ángel Pozo in attack for a consecutive start as he is a forward by trade, or perhaps turn to James Milner, Samir Nasri or David Silva to knit the side together when moving forward. Pellegrini, though, can be delighted at being only three points behind Chelsea following their early season travails yet Neil Warnock’s Palace may prove awkward opposition. Jamie Jackson	14/15

The Baggies did not exactly blow Aston Villa away though, and Harry Redknapp will be well aware that QPR, in front of their own fans, can exploit his side. Is it to soon to call this a ‘six-pointer? Maybe, but both clubs need a victory to help spread the festive cheer. Graham Searles	14/15

However they are so ravaged by injury and suspension that Toby Alderweireld may start in midfield to add steel. Everton arrive five places and points below them but travel to the south coast after overcoming a winless league run of four with a 3-1 victory over QPR on Monday. Alan Smith	14/15

The club fired a positive vibe at White Hart Lane with the midweek League Cup win over Newcastle, as they had done in the league victory against Everton, but on too many occasions Spurs have stumbled at home against teams that are below them in the table. Burnley have found form but Tottenham know that a win is essential. David Hytner	14/15

While Sam Allardyce’s side have risen to fourth place after losing one of their past 10, the goals have dried up for Leicester, who are without a win in 11. The pressure on their manager, Nigel Pearson, is increasing and only a win at Upton Park would give Leicester a chance of not being bottom at Christmas. Jacob Steinberg	14/15

Arsène Wenger will shudder at the memory of his last visit, February’s 5-1 humiliation that holed his then Premier League leaders’ title credentials and reinforced Liverpool’s own in the process. Arsenal must also improve on their last away league display at Stoke City to avoid any nasty confrontations at Lime Street Station afterwards. Andy Hunter	14/15

He could do without having his novice third-choice goalkeeper, Jak Alnwick, protecting his defence. Not to mention being up against Gus Poyet. The Uruguayan was labelled “a scourge of this club” by Sir Bobby Robson when, as a Chelsea and Spurs player, he was prone to scoring against the Tynesiders. Key subplots include the likely midfield duel between Moussa Sissoko and Sunderland’s Lee Cattermole and the performance of Newcastle’s Jack Colback against his former employers. Louise Taylor	14/15

But with Charlie Austin in excellent goalscoring form and Arsenal’s defence looking as leaky as a ripped sieve, a shock could be on the cards should the visitors show ambition from the outset.

Without Daniel Sturridge, though, they lack a consistent goal threat and never look like producing last season’s form. Sean Dyche is making progress at Burnley but he will be hoping Liverpool stumble again in his quest to move out of danger. Graham Searles	14/15

West Ham, in the top four at Christmas for the first time since 1985, will provide another stern test of the hosts’ title aspirations even if it is 12 years since the Hammers last triumphed down the District Line. With Arsenal to follow on the 28th, these next two derby fixtures will offer an indication of the strengths of Sam Allardyce’s side. Dominic Fifield	14/15

Roberto Martínez needs to find a settled, more incisive team fast and Stoke City, with only one win in their past six league games, would leapfrog Everton with a victory. Troubled times for both.

Mauricio Pochettino, however, will be feeling much better after a run of three victories in all competitions. A win would be a long overdue Christmas present for the Foxes but against high-spirited Tottenham Hotspur it could be a long shot. Graham Searles	14/15

Newcastle United arrive having lost their past two, a resounding 4-1 defeat at Arsenal and the late 1-0 Tyne-Wear derby reverse, so their manager, Alan Pardew, is once again in need-of-a-win mode.

Sunderland’s former manager is unlikely to be welcomed by his less than adoring public but Gus Poyet’s team remain short of wins themselves and could do with building on last Sunday’s morale-boosting victory at Newcastle. Hulls’s Ahmed Elmohamady and David Meyler will be keen to upstage their former Sunderland team-mates. Louise Taylor	14/15

Conversely Aston Villa lose Gabby Agbonlahor through suspension and Paul Lambert will no doubt be worried about his growing list of absentees. On current form Swansea should prevail but it would certainly be far from a Christmas miracle if Aston Villa shocked the home support. Graham Searles	14/15

Manuel Pellegrini must be elated with how his side are playing despite having a significantly depleted strike force. Alan Irvine will be buoyed by James Milner starting but with the quality Pellegrini has at his disposal in midfield this somewhat leftfield choice will probably not change the result.

The hosts’ mini-revival has seen them draw with Manchester City, Newcastle and Spurs in their past three games in all competitions, but an elusive an elusive three points is a must against relegation rivals Hoops, who lost 30 last weekend in the FA Cup to giantkillers Sheffield United.

José Mourinho’s side were eight points clear of Manchester City in November, but are now top only on alphabetical order and they will be determined to quash any talk of them looking vulnerable.

The question is a fresh approach and renewed optimism will be enough for Palace to compensate for the new manager’s chances are not helped by the absence of key duo Mile Jedinak and Yannick Bolasie, both of whom are away on international duty.

The champions are unbeaten in 13 matches, winning 11, and could have Sergio Agüero, Edin Dzeko and Vincent Kompany back for the trip to what promises to be a tense Goodison Park.

The divisional draw specialists, Sunderland are difficult to beat but have won only one of their past 10 Premier League games and are likely to be without the influential Lee Cattermole.

Paul Lambert’s side are without a win in six league games and have not scored in their last four. Their new signing Carles Gil could make his debut from the bench and in doing so might provide Christian Benteke with some much-needed quality service in the final third. Graham Searles	14/15

Crystal Palace may feel they have the edge with Alan Pardew at the helm, but Sean Dyche will be supremely focused on producing a positive display after capitulating in the FA Cup to Tottenham in midweek.

Despite relegation looming large over the Foxes the mood in Leicester will have lifted recently with two wins in three and the signing of the prolific young Croatian striker, Andrej Kramaric. Stoke City were poor last time out against Arsenal and will have to improve to get a positive result. Graham Searles	14/15

John Carver - who turned 50 on Friday - will hope to board the plane celebrating his first victory since succeeding Alan Pardew in a caretaker capacity. Carver knows a win would enhance his chances of keeping the job until the end of the season but could have wished for less formidable opponents than Champions League challengers Southampton. Much may depend on the form of the returning Fraser Forster, the visiting goalkeeper and Newcastle academy graduate. Louise Taylor	14/15

Manchester United will hope to plunge QPR into deeper trouble and will be determined to get back on track after last Sunday’s defeat against Southampton. With Robin van Persie injured, Radamel Falcao is set to return for United. Jacob Steinberg	14/15

Chelsea could potentially move further ahead of title rivals Manchester City as the latter could drop points against Arsenal. While Swansea will be relying on Bafétimbi Gomis to replace the goal threat of Wilfried Bony, the Frenchman may lack the quality needed to break down Chelsea’s solid defensive line.

The visitors will hope that Defoe continues his record of scoring on debut for every club he has played for to help produce a shock result. Spurs, however, have a new talisman in Harry Kane and no doubt will rely on the Englishman to provide the difference. Graham Searles	14/15

His good friend, Steve Bruce, however, is in more desperate need. The Hull manager is enduring what he has called the worst injury crisis of his 17 years in management and, if results go against him on Saturday, his team could kick off at the bottom of the table.

There is no margin for error for Roberto Martínez. Everton are three points above the relegation zone, have won once in 12 games, have exited both domestic cup competitions at the opening hurdle for the first time in their history and are facing a difficult February.

His star striker’s unwitting tread on the foot of an opponent has been ‘distorted’ into a stamping storm and suspension while the Chelsea manager himself is £25,000 lighter for having had the temerity to suggest that the world is indeed against him. He might be without not only Diego Costa but Cesc Fàbregas, who has a hamstring issue, against a City side who are having a wobble. Expect more fireworks. David Hytner	14/15

Alan Pardew, who had scored a winner against the Merseysiders five years earlier, has won his four games in charge to date while Roberto Martínez’s team arrive with one win in 13 to their name.

They are currently enduring a catastrophic run of injuries and Steve Bruce has openly criticised key players. Defeat to Newcastle United could send them bottom, but the away side have not won since Alan Pardew left. John Carver needs three points to quell doubts over his appointment. Charles Crook	14/15

Stewart Downing and Andy Carroll have a point to prove against the manager who ended their Anfield careers, Brendan Rodgers, but his team have taken 14 points from a possible 18 since losing to Manchester United and have Daniel Sturridge back for the first time since August.

This is causing the quite reasonable question: does the Dutchman, despite his vast experience, actually know his best team? The one he selected for the reverse fixture went down 5-3 to Leicester City on a September afternoon of crazy defending from Van Gaal’s side. A repeat at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon and serious questions will surely be posed. Jamie Jackson	14/15

Mark Hughes’s task ahead of meeting his former employers is to find new inspiration in the Spaniard’s absence. Harry Redknapp also has a pressing mission to try to end QPR’s abysmal away form. The west Londoners have lost every single away league game so far, and another defeat will put their survival aspirations in more danger. Charles Crook	14/15

Might Jermain Defoe score his first goal in a Sunderland shirt? Can Gus Poyet preside over what would only be his team’s second Premier League win at the Stadium of Light all season? With the Uruguayan’s recent comments about Sunderland fans “living in the past” having not been well received on Wearside, Poyet desperately needs this classic relegation six pointer to conclude with a home win. Sean Dyche’s Burnley are unlikely to make it easy. Louise Taylor	14/15

Pulis will want to avoid a repeat of last season’s meeting when the home side led Tottenham 3-0 only to draw.

Liverpool have won eight of their past 14 matches, Everton two in 14. Hence his astonishment. Everton did collect a crucial first win of 2015 at Crystal Palace last Saturday and will need to maintain the dogged defending of Selhurst Park as Steven Gerrard looks to bow out of this historic fixture emphatically.

Palace have included Keshi Anderson, 19, after he scored a six-minute hat-trick against them last week and one for the under-21s after signing from non-league Barton Rovers for £30k. ‘The headlights are still full-on for him,’ said Alan Pardew.

Unfortunately for them, Ronald Koeman’s team travel to Loftus Road determined to atone for their unexpected defeat to Swansea and should be bolstered by the returns of some key players. But with Chris Ramsey and Les Ferdinand taking charge following the resignation of Harry Redknapp, there is hope of an upswing in form for QPR, too. Paul Doyle	14/15

Jermain Defoe opened his Sunderland account last week, and his goals could just keep them out of the relegation battle. Paul Chronnell	14/15

Both teams are on form and this promises to be another telling encounter between sides separated by one place and two points. Paul Chronnell	14/15

Darren Fletcher is set to go straight into a West Brom side looking to bounce back from their first defeat under Tony Pulis, who may decide to bench Saido Berahino after the striker’s ill-conceived interview this week.

Much as Hughes has imbued Tony Pulis’s old Stoke side with new-found creativity, Carver’s side is rather more attack-minded than Alan Pardew’s, with the previously struggling – and often sidelined – Rémy Cabella suddenly blossoming under his guidance.

A chance, then, for Wayne Rooney to score for the first time in 2015, and perhaps from the halfway line, as he did during his last match at this stadium. Sachin Nakrani	14/15

He certainly talks a good game but turning around his side’s recent form will be a very tough task. However, there is no better time to face Stoke City at home as they have lost 4-1 in consecutive matches on the road. Mark Hughes will not want to witness a third away drubbing and will be looking to upset Sherwood on his debut. Graham Searles	14/15

Diego Costa returns to the starting lineup after suspension, which will strike fear into Burnley hearts. Sean Dyche, however, will remind his players of Bradford’s unbelievable FA Cup upset at Stamford Bridge and will want them to reproduce that magic. Graham Searles	14/15

Arsène Wenger’s side have lost once since New Year’s Day and they are starting to build some momentum. Yet Crystal Palace are likely to be difficult opponents. They still need a few more points to ensure that they are not dragged into the relegation scrap. Jacob Steinberg	14/15

Chris Ramsey presided over QPR’s first away win of the season and he will be looking for a repeat performance to stay out of trouble. Steve Bruce, meanwhile, will want new signing Dame N’Doye to build on his promising debut. Graham Searles	14/15

With José Mourinho’s side seven points ahead and only 13 matches remaining, City’s challenge is to go for a maximum return of 39 and hope Chelsea slip up. As it is seven years since the Magpies managed even a draw against City in the Premier League, Manuel Pellegrini should feel confident. Jamie Jackson	14/15

Sunderland’s manager cannot be overly delighted at the prospect of clapping eyes on Brown Ideye, West Brom’s in-form £10m striker either as Pulis’s renascent side aim to exacerbate the Uruguayan’s recent misery. After writing an extraordinary open letter to Sunderland fans, begging for their backing, Poyet could do with his side registering what would be only their third home league win all season. Should they stumble, what happens next is anyone’s guess. Louise Taylor	14/15

Since then Swansea have been inconsistent and one fears for the Swans hosting United, with their current ability to get results without playing dazzling football. Louis van Gaal knows a win is important to keep the chasing pack looking for Champions League qualification at bay. Graham Searles	14/15

Roberto Martínez’s side again showed they are more at home in the Europa League than domestically with the 4-1 win over Young Boys in Bern. Confidence should have improved as a result, although Everton have won only two of six matches following European exertions so far this season. Andy Hunter	14/15

They confront a Liverpool team who have found their own upbeat rhythm, with one loss in 17 and, in Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren, players who will relish returning to their former haunts. Only four points separate these sides at kick‑off. Each can deliver a statement of renewed intent with victory. Dominic Fifield	14/15

This as an opportune moment for West Ham to head to White Hart Lane and if they are triumphant then European qualification hopes will be ignited. Most importantly for Spurs, Harry Kane returns after being rested in midweek. Graham Searles	14/15

Swansea are 15 points away from the bottom three, 10 points short of the top four and went out of the FA Cup at Blackburn last week and thus would appear to have little to play for in their final 12 games. Sean Dyche’s side must make the most of games like this if they are to defy the odds and stay up. Rich Flower	14/15

He is likely to be partnered in attack by James Wilson, who has, arguably, outshone his more illustrious – and considerably higher paid – team-mate this season. Sunderland, with one win from their past 10 league games, need at least a point on Saturday to guarantee they will not be sucked into the bottom three. Rich Flower	14/15

If Carver could do with a reassuring victory, Tim Sherwood will sense an opportunity to secure the first win of his Villa tenure. It should be intriguing to assess precisely how much more direct the new manager is making Paul Lambert’s old team. With both sides extremely swift on the break, this promises to be all about counter-attacking. Louise Taylor	14/15

Wins over Aston Villa and QPR and a draw at Manchester City have lifted Hull to 15th but Steve Bruce is under no illusions and has warned his players they remain in a “horrible dogfight”.

Ronald Koeman’s side have taken 13 points from a possible 15 away, although they will have to be at their best to continue that run against Albion, who are edging clear of the relegation zone and looking for a fifth clean sheet in seven league games under Tony Pulis.

Yet they will be confident of getting back to winning ways against Crystal Palace, who are five points above the bottom three.

Dyche will have his fingers crossed for more of the same on Saturday, but the game will mean just as much to City who know they can’t afford to drop any more points if they have any chance at all of catching Chelsea for the title.

If Rangers can abstain from ruining good general displays with sudden defensive mistakes, they might just get a positive result at Selhurst Park, where Palace remain a little vulnerable.

Steve Bruce’s Hull have won only one of their last 13 away matches, and have won only one of their last seven league meetings with Leicester.

Should Tim Sherwood choreograph a third straight victory for Aston Villa the mood on Wearside could well turn ugly. If Gus Poyet would be well advised to have a tin hat at hand on a day when he must cope without the suspended Lee Cattermole and Adam Johnson, Sherwood remains wary of Jermain Defoe’s potential penalty area menace.

Efforts will be made to liberate Diego Costa and revive Cesc Fàbregas after recent stodgy form, and Southampton will arrive braced for a backlash and have been suffering themselves of late – even their much-needed 1-0 win over Crystal Palace was not fluent. Both these teams are in need of a performance. Dominic Fifield	14/15

Tension was palpable inside Goodison Park against the Ukrainian league leaders, something John Carver’s side will look to capitalise on as they bid to improve a poor run of one win in eight Premier League away matches, but Everton held their nerve and rediscovered their verve to record a merited win. They must start in that vein on Sunday with the threat of relegation creeping. Andy Hunter	14/15

United stand only three points ahead of Spurs in fourth place in the “rat race”, as Van Gaal continues to call it, for a Champions League berth.

With no change on the injury front, Sherwood’s only selection dilemma is whether Leandro Bacuna, who was excellent at Sunderland, should keep his place now that Alan Hutton is back from suspension.

Aware of Papiss Cissé and Fabricio Coloccini’s suspensions, Arsène Wenger will sense an opportunity for Arsenal to mitigate their midweek Champions League disappointment against Monaco by continuing to conclude the League campaign in convincing style. Holland’s Daryl Janmaat, one of Carver’s two available senior defenders, will relocate from right-back to replace Coloccini at centre-half. Louise Taylor	14/15

That result left Brendan Rodgers’ team 10th in the table and 10 points behind United but their recovery has been outstanding, with 33 points taken from the last 39 available.

Loïc Rémy’s winner at Hull City in their last fixture may end up as one of the campaign’s key goals. Stoke are safe and, despite having lost their last two games, will test the hosts’ resolve. “A difficult team,” said José Mourinho. An awkward, if not daunting, afternoon lies ahead for the leaders.

Ronald Koeman will hope the 38-year-old goalkeeper Kelvin Davis maintains the form that denied Burnley on his first league start for almost 15 months, with Fraser Forster out for the season, and his task will be helped if Romelu Lukaku fails a fitness test on a hamstring injury.

Yet as the final stretch of the “rat race” to qualify for the Champions League is entered Aston Villa arrive at Old Trafford having drawn 1-1 in the reverse fixture, despite having only 10 men for the final 25 minutes due to Gabriel Agbonlahor’s red card in that December game.

As Dick Advocaat takes charge of Sunderland for the second time much looks set to hinge on the likely midfield duel involving the home enforcer Lee Cattermole and Moussa Sissoko.

Their recent record at Crystal Palace is excellent, the hosts having failed to prevail in this fixture since December 2001, though Alan Pardew’s team have been resurgent of late.The visitors will enjoy the possession, but must be guarded for the pace on the counter offered by Jason Puncheon, Wilfried Zaha and Yannick Bolasie.

The visitors are in search of their eighth successive victory in all competitions, while Burnley have just one win from their past 10 games.

A fifth-place finish is still very much within the home side’s grasp and that would represent a fine achievement for Ronald Koeman in his debut season. A lack of firepower has been the main reason for Southampton’s deteriorating results but their overall performances have remained impressive and they should be too strong for a creaking Hull side in danger of being sucked into the relegation zone. If Steve Bruce’s side are to save themselves, it will probably be during their remaining home fixtures. Paul Doyle	14/15

As Newcastle United manager he lost his last four north-east derbies against Sunderland and will be anxious to see his Palace side wreak revenge on Dick Advocaat’s relegation-threatened team. Advocaat is likely to be wary of Palace’s counterattacking threat as he aims to build on last Sunday’s home triumph against John Carver’s Newcastle. Even if the current mini-heatwave continues, Sunderland’s Dutch manager is expected to wear his lucky brown winter scarf. Louise Taylor	14/15

For Roberto Martínez it is back to the club where it all started as a manager and after a season’s best three league wins in a row, will be looking to extend that as the race for places and prize money intensifies.

How he would love to get one over on his former club and show Tottenham Hotspur that they were wrong to sack him last summer, although it is not all about revenge for the Villa manager. His team are a mere three points above the bottom three and are winless in their past three matches. Yet putting an end to that worrying run will not be straightforward against Spurs, who have not completely given up hope of finishing in the top four. Jacob Steinberg	14/15

Leicester, buoyed by a win over West Ham a week ago, need to keep building momentum if they are to defy the odds and survive an immediate return to the Championship.

The hosts have lost four of their past five matches and go into the game level on points with Stoke, who have lost their previous three. This hardly suggests a classic is in store but keep an eye on Peter Crouch, who is one headed goal away from Alan Shearer’s Premier League record of 46. Ben Fisher	14/15

Can Manuel Pellegrini’s champions halt a slide that has featured three defeats in the past five league games?

José Mourinho has no qualms about selecting Nemanja Matic or Cesc Fàbregas, both of whom are one booking away from a two-match ban before the weekend cut-off. “We need points, we need victories, we cannot choose matches,” he said. The same applies to the hosts. Dominic Fifield	14/15

Liverpool restored confidence by reaching the FA Cup semi-finals on Wednesday but, after consecutive defeats in the Premier League, can ill afford another slip if they are to catch any of the teams above them in the race for Champions League qualification. Newcastle should be safe on 35 points but, after the misery of another derby loss and amid growing supporter unrest, John Carver desperately needs to stem the decline. Andy Hunter	14/15

Phil Jones, Michael Carrick, Daley Blind, Marcos Rojo and Jonny Evans will all be absent, but there will be no sympathy from José Mourinho. “Their squad is amazing, in numbers, players, experience, solutions,” said the Portuguese, whose side can move 11 points clear of their visitors with victory. Chelsea, who will give a late check to Loïc Rémy, know a win will bring the title tantalisingly within reach. Dominic Fifield	14/15

Pulis initially performed a similar feat at The Hawthorns too, but returns to Palace after successive home defeats to QPR and Leicester that mean Albion are not safe yet. Paul Chronnell	14/15

Burnley, glad to see the back of eight matches against the league’s top eight, will be fighting hard to pick up three points in their fight to stay up at Goodison, which is not the fortress that it was last season.

Bottom of the table since November, the Foxes could leap out of the relegation zone with victory over a depleted Swansea side. While Garry Monk has to decide who to turn to for goals in the absence of striker Bafétimbi Gomis, Nigel Pearson has a fully fit squad and players who are infused with confidence following two successive victories. Erratic finishing has been a recurring problem for Leicester this season, but if they are wearing their shooting boots on Saturday, the hosts could claim a precious three points. Paul Doyle	14/15

The Saints are five points behind fourth-placed Manchester City and will believe that overhauling the champions is still possible.

If the champions were to suffer a seventh defeat in nine outings to continue their slump in 2015 – City were joint-top on New Year’s Day and are now fourth – the manager’s position may become untenable. In this scenario Liverpool, who are in FA Cup semi-final action this weekend, could close to only a point behind if they won their extra match. A victory, though, and Pellegrini’s garden, and that of City’s, becomes far rosier. Jamie Jackson	14/15

With Christian Benteke in better goalscoring form than his countryman Romelu Lukaku, the manager is wary but optimistic. Everton are unbeaten in six games, last lost to Villa in August 2010 and not yet on the beach. Mark Tallentire	14/15

Leicester played well when losing to Chelsea in midweek and will be confident of recording a fifth win in six matches. Paul Doyle	14/15

The statistics do not augur well for Chris Ramsey’s team but they can take hope from the hangover Liverpool have been nursingsince their FA Cup semi-final defeat. Champions League qualification is fading from view for Brendan Rodgers’ men. Steven Gerrard, having been rested for the midweek defeat at Hull City, is available to make his penultimate Anfield appearance. Andy Hunter	14/15

The Dutchman put the 3-0 humiliation at Goodison Park down as a one-off. Expect Van Gaal to be a little less sanguine should struggling West Brom turn United over and make it a twice-off.

While Sunderland are desperate to avenge an 8-0 humiliation at Southampton earlier in the season and Dick Advocaat is determined to keep them in the Premier League, Ronald Koeman remains on a mission to transport Southampton into Europe. Something has to give in this double-Dutch tactical duel but it will be no surprise if years of haphazard recruitment and general decision making continue to take their toll on a north east club who could do with emulating Southampton’s slick, intelligent synchronicity and efficiency behind the scenes.

Garry Monk described the game as probably Swansea’s most important of the season, but Stoke will rely on their top scorer Mame Biram Diouf or perhaps on another strike from the in-form Charlie Adam, who will play with a protective mask after breaking his nose in training.

West Ham, with only one win in their last 13 games, seem ideal opposition. Paul Chronnell	14/15

The hosts will secure the crown with victory and, given their unbeaten home record this season and Crystal Palace’s recent slip in standards with safety assured, the opportunity is there for the taking. “Them winning the league would be deserved because they’ve done extraordinarily well this season,” said Yannick Bolasie, “but we don’t want them to do it against us.” That may be wishful thinking given it is 33 years since Palace last won at Chelsea.

City will not win the title but they will finish in the top four while Tottenham will surely not finish in the top four and nor are they are relishing the chase for Europa League qualification. The worry for Manuel Pellegrini is that there is also an end-of-era feel to it. The manager’s job prospects at City are uncertain while his ageing squad looks set for a summer reboot.

Gabriel Agbonlahor returns from injury but will start on the bench against a West Ham side who have a chance to qualify for Europe via the fair play table. What a test for Reece Burke, the 18-year-old defender, who will be up against an in-form Christian Benteke. Stuart James	14/15

United, who have lost Michael Carrick for the rest of the season, will hope for better. The recent wobble has left their Champions League place under threat from Liverpool and it will not be straightforward against Palace, who beat Manchester City at Selhurst Park last month. Palace’s Wilfried Zaha will be eager to show his former club that they were wrong to sell him. Jacob Steinberg	14/15

With fixtures at the Emirates and Stamford Bridge still to come, this is Sunderland’s least testing trip of the run-in. However, it will still be tough as there is a fierce determination in the Everton squad to finish a disappointing season strongly. Graham Searles	14/15

One more win might be enough to keep them in the division, while defeat would hugely increase the threat of relegation. Burnley, of course, have to win all their remaining three games to have any chance of remaining in the top flight. Graham Searles	14/15

Leicester have won five of their past six games and will know that another victory will take them toward safety. Ronald Koeman is missing key players in Morgan Schneiderlin and Dusan Tadic and could struggle to break down Leicester as a result. Graham Searles	14/15

Yet even the very highest-calibre coaches rarely relish visits from Tony Pulis. West Brom would certainly enjoy compounding Newcastle’s relegation troubles by consigning them to a ninth straight defeat. How Carver could do without two key defenders, Daryl Janmaat and Mike Williamson, suspended. At least Papiss Cissé should be back on the home bench, though. Louise Taylor	14/15

Or should that be the race to avoid it? Fifth and sixth place will certainly qualify for Thursday night fun – but seventh will too if the FA Cup final goes to form and is won by Arsenal. Stoke are out of the running, for which they may just be thankful. Paul Chronnell	14/15

The visitors’ captain will hardly care, and there is likely to be a show of respect from José Mourinho for a player he has always admired. Chelsea should be rested after four days off. Liverpool, clinging to faint hopes of a top-four finish, must become the first visiting team to triumph here this season. Dominic Fifield	14/15

With Manchester City having won three on the bounce there should only be one result. But there will be an different feel at the Etihad Stadium to when these clubs met on the final day three years ago and Sergio Agüero scored that goal.

He may be forced into one switch when Swansea visit, as Aaron Ramsey is rated 50-50 after sustaining a knock to the fibula against Hull. Nick Ames	14/15

The pressure here will be on Newcastle as they desperately seek a victory that could spare them an agonising final day.

Not exactly roasting but warm enough to discard winter scarves – well unless you are Dick Advocaat. Sunderland’s manager has wrapped his neck in a piece of “lucky” brown wool – “stylish eh,” he says – ever since succeeding Gus Poyet and, after wearing it during last week’s rather flukey win at Everton, is unlikely to dispense with it. A game Advocaat could do with winning slightly more than Nigel Pearson. The influence of Sunderland’s Jordi Gómez and Leicester’s Matty James will be missed after both sustained serious knee injuries. Louise Taylor	14/15

However, one plus is that they cannot be relegated this weekend. Steve Bruce will tell his players that three points are essential given the form of their relegation rivals. Also they travel to Old Trafford on the final day of the season. It is obvious why Hull are favourites to be relegated. Graham Searles	14/15

Or should that be the race to avoid the Europa League? It will be interesting to see how many times Kevin Friend has to reach for his cards. West Ham may have Winston Reid back after hamstring trouble, but Everton’s Leighton Baines is missing after having ankle surgery. Jacob Steinberg	14/15

A positive result against City on Sunday could even see Garry Monk’s side snatch a Europa League spot at the end of May, especially if Arsenal win the FA Cup. The visitors, however, will take a big step towards securing second in the table with a win, particularly if Manchester United do them a favour against Arsenal later in the day. Rich Flower	14/15

But even though Aston Villa’s top-flight place is safe and already-relegated Burnley are heading to Villa Park, he has vowed not to rest players.

Dick Advocaat’s achievement in retaining Sunderland’s top flight status should be lauded. José Mourinho, the manager of the season, would have preferred to have hoisted the silverware after the victory over Crystal Palace earlier this month but will still savour the moment as he flings more youngsters into the fray to gain experience. He pinpointed the 5-3 defeat at Tottenham on New Year’s Day as psychologically important for his team. They have not looked back since. Dominic Fifield	14/15

For Roberto Martínez, the aim is to hold on to a place in the top half after a difficult season and, possibly, give Sylvain Distin a more fitting end to a fine Everton career having frozen the veteran defender out of his plans since January.

Now, on what seems virtually certain to be his final game in charge of the visitors, he can possibly help push his old club into the Championship. If John Carver has been heartened to learn that West Ham’s players were all given most of this week off, his team’s recent record of does not inspire confidence.

David de Gea will not play because he is distracted by Real Madrid’s interest and to replace his No1 the manager has only the untested Sam Johnstone or Sergio Romero. Bastian Schweinsteiger, his headline central midfield summer signing, is not match-fit and, if Wayne Rooney was to suffer injury, Van Gaal has only Javier Hernández or James Wilson to replace his central striker. Given the £230m investment the manager has overseen in his 12 months in charge United should still defeat Tottenham. Jamie Jackson	15/16

There is also a change of personnel in the home dug-out where Steve McClaren makes his first competitive appearance as Newcastle United’s manager. It is the former England coach’s first return to the Premier League since leaving Middlesbrough nine years ago and Tynesiders will be keen to assess his philosophy and tactics while also taking a first look at Newcastle’s three summer signings, Georginio Wijnaldum, Alexsandar Mitrovic and Chancel Mbemba.

Both teams have undergone substantial change since Stoke humiliated Brendan Rodgers’ men 6-1 on the final day of last season with Mark Hughes making eight signings this summer, including the former Liverpool right-back Glen Johnson, compared to Liverpool’s seven.

Dick Advocaat aims to adjust the mood by offering Yann M’Vila a debut alongside Lee Cattermole in central midfield. On loan from Rubin Kazan, M’Vila has already made quite an impact, having been sent off for head-butting an opponent in an appearance for Sunderland’s Under-21s.

Newcastle are without Paul Dummett and Rémy Cabella but £13m striker Aleksandar Mitrovic is in contention to start after coming off the bench last weekend, though the man he may replace, Papiss Cissé, has four goals in his previous three visits to South Wales.

Either way, Stoke’s £12m signing Xherdan Shaqiri will not be involved due to a suspension carried over from his time playing for Internazionale. Sachin Nakrani	15/16

West Brom will want to atone for a feeble performance against Manchester City. Both clubs’ record signings, Steven Berghuis and Salomon Rondón, could debut from the bench. Simon Burnton	15/16

Reece Oxford should start in midfield again for West Ham after his starring role against Arsenal, while Jamie Vardy is expected to play for Leicester after the club disciplined him for making a racial slur at a fellow gambler in a casino.

After the shock defeat to West Ham, which actually did not feel that shocking, they must, to borrow the well-worn Arsène Wenger line, show that they have the quality to respond. “It’s how you respond that makes your season,” Wenger said, for the 187th time. Alexis Sánchez is champing at the bit to be unleashed from the start but it will not be easy at Palace, where morale is high. David Hytner	15/16

Whether the latter will materially affect the club is to be discovered, and following City’s fine 3-0 win at West Brom, which Albion Manuel Pellegrini’s side are favourites. However, it still would not surprise if Mourinho leaves the Etihad Stadium with three points. Jamie Jackson	15/16

Liverpool created fewer chances in their first game at Stoke City but took the three points that matter and, for all the pressure on Brendan Rodgers going into the campaign, his club have an ideal chance to start with two wins for only the fifth time in the Premier League era.

There was no shame in the narrow defeat to Arsenal last week but last season’s record of 10 defeats at Selhurst Park was poor. By contrast, Villa won at Bournemouth on the opening day and will be confident they can repeat last season’s victory on Saturday afternoon. Ed Aarons	15/16

It will be interesting to whether Inler’s arrival will lead to the manager tinkering with a line-up that has recorded wins in their first two matches. Tottenham need to improve the support to Harry Kane and wring more resilience from a defence that folded late against Stoke last week if they are to stop Leicester making it three wins in a row.

With Wayne Rooney misfiring, the manager will more than likely lean on the fast-flourishing attacking threat of Memphis Depay to break down Newcastle. Steve McClaren will be conscious that Newcastle’s defending has to improve, after Jefferson Montero tore them apart last Saturday, if they are to secure a positive result from the encounter.

Neil would like a new striker but, for now at least, Gary Hooper and Ricky van Wolfswinkel remain options. Xherdan Shaqiri stands to make his debut for Stoke, whose comeback at White Hart Lane last Saturday suggests the Canaries will have to work hard for the kind of home win that might keep them up.

After conceding seven goals in their opening two games, even the Wearside club’s new shirt sponsors, the bookmaker Dafabet, are tipping them for relegation. Dick Advocaat aims to change the narrative but may find Montero, Bafetimbi Gomis and friends unforgiving opponents. His predecessor Gus Poyet wanted to model Sunderland on Swansea but that now seems a distant dream. Louise Taylor	15/16

Eddie Howe’s side are goalless and pointless after their first two matches. Will it be third time lucky against West Ham? Slaven Bilic’s side are reeling from their defeat to Leicester City last Saturday and Upton Park will a nervy place if the Cherries pick up their first Premier League win. Jacob Steinberg	15/16

It felt, at the time, as though Koeman had been lined up before Flores’s dismissal. Flores has eyes only for beating Koeman’s Southampton and building on Watford’s solid start. Koeman needs a response after last Saturday’s humbling against Everton. David Hytner	15/16

André Villas Boas and Roberto di Matteo were ousted soon after defeats in the Black Country and, while the same fate will not await José Mourinho, this is still an awkward trip at a tricky time. The champions are enduring their worst start since 1998 and, having toasted the arrivals of Baba Rahman and Pedro Rodríguez, are anxious for a first win this term. Tony Pulis has beaten Mourinho with Crystal Palace and West Brom in the last 16 months. His own side’s slow start to the season could also do with a fillip. Dominic Fifield	15/16

They arrive at the Emirates with a pristine record to date, but with only one win at Arsenal in 15 years and with the hosts intent upon making amends for their opening weekend home defeat to West Ham. Arsène Wenger’s side looked more like their spritely selves at Selhurst Park last Sunday and pose far more of a threat with the forward propulsion of Alexis Sánchez in their ranks. Liverpool cannot permit the Chilean the same space to revel afforded him by Palace. Dominic Fifield	15/16

Aston Villa had their own scare against lower division opposition in midweek and have been inconsistent, but even in the games they have lost, they have been competitive. Rudy Gestede should be able to bully Sunderland’s fragile defence and create chances for himself and fellow attackers. Graham Searles	15/16

But the Leicester manager, Claudio Ranieri, is also flying high as his side remain unbeaten. Two form players will come head to head, with Callum Wilson looking to build on his hat-trick at Upton Park while the Leicester winger, Riyad Mahrez, has scored six goals in his last six league games. Ben Fisher	15/16

John Terry’s absence is a blow, though José Mourinho will be acutely aware of the threat the visitors pose on the flanks. Alan Pardew might rue the absence of the underused Mile Jedinak with a hamstring injury though Connor Wickham’s availability after a rib injury is a boost. Dominic Fifield	15/16

For perspective, however, it is worth noting his club’s last win at Anfield came courtesy of goals from Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters in September 1963. Liverpool will equal their best start to a Premier League season after four matches with a win and are aiming to keep four clean sheets in a row for the first time since 2011. Andy Hunter	15/16

Nine points, eight goals scored, and none allowed from the first three matches has changed opinions about City’s title chances. Watford have drawn three this season and given how City eased past Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium, Quique Flores’s men may be grateful if they can avoid a rout. Jamie Jackson	15/16

Admired by, among others, Arsène Wenger, Sissoko appears destined to remain on Tyneside. Having invested nearly £50m in players during this window Newcastle are adamant they have no intention of selling any key players. “We don’t need to sell and we don’t want to sell,” said McClaren who may offer a League debut to one time Arsenal target Florian Thauvin. The former Marseille winger shone against Northampton in midweek. Louise Taylor	15/16

This will be anything but a classic. Stoke look like the more settled side of the two and on paper have the edge in attack over West Brom. However Tony Pulis will be highly motivated against his former club and will be hoping his players can rebut criticism of their early form. Graham Searles	15/16

Spurs will need to defend brilliantly for the whole match for a change to keep the visitors at bay, with Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku in dangerous form. Paul Doyle	15/16

United cut loose against Club Brugge on Wednesday when Wayne Rooney scored a hat-trick but their domestic form has been unconvincing, with one positive being the three clean sheets Sergio Romero has kept in goal.

They have won the past 13 meetings in north London and Stoke must go back to 1981 for their last victory. Arsenal need a continuation of the normal order after drawing blanks in both of their home games so far this season. Stoke are carrying a few injuries and suspensions but they travel with confidence.

The subject matter has meandered on to the Crusades when the Crystal Palace associate director interjects: “… and then, in the second half, on came Bolasie and Palace ended up winning 2-1 to go second in the table.” Chelsea were beaten last time out. Now Alan Pardew’s side aim to repeat April’s victory over Manchester City, the only side above them in the fledgling table. Izzard will be performing at the the Mountain Winery in Saratoga on Saturday night. He will hope he has further tweaks to make to his routine. Dominic Fifield	15/16

The reigning champions are eight points adrift of Manchester City with four games gone and are still searching for the confidence, form and power that contributed to a 6-3 win here early last season. Everton’s injury problems at left-back, where the new £9.5m signing Ramiro Funes Mori may have to make his debut out of position, could be exploited. Andy Hunter	15/16

The latest seismic week at Manchester United ends with the visit of Liverpool. These firmest of enemies each have seven points and would love to end Saturday’s late game with three more and bragging rights for their supporters. Last season, Van Gaal’s team gave Liverpool a 3-0 schooling in the corresponding fixture. This time it may be closer. Jamie Jackson	15/16

They do so without the suspended Steven Whittaker, who is likely to be replaced by Andre Wisdom, but welcome Dieumerci Mbokani and Matthew Jarvis into the fold. The former, at least, is likely to start on the bench through a lack of match fitness. Lewis Grabban could return to the squad after a club suspension. Bournemouth must regroup after the long-term injuries suffered by expensive signings Tyrone Mings and Max Gradel before the international break. Nick Ames	15/16

That appears quite a challenge against Swansea, who were triumphant against Manchester United before the international break and are led by the increasingly impressive and influential Bafétimbi Gomis.

The West Brom manager, Pulis, has watched his team stutter minus their star striker, Saido Berahino, who may feature here, while his Southampton counterpart, Koeman, will have been relieved that they ended a worrying start with a convincing win over Norwich before the international break. Expect a tight contest. Alan Smith	15/16

Gökhan Inler’s performance for Switzerland against England in midweek may have convinced Claudio Ranieri that the midfielder is ready for his first start since joining in the summer, but the manager will mostly be looking for more of the same from a side who have made a strong start to the season. Villa will have to improve to avoid defeat. Paul Doyle	15/16

That job is now earmarked for Fabio Borini. Newly returned to Sunderland following his £7m move from Liverpool, Borini is already “feeling the love” from fans. Considerably less warmth will be directed towards Advocaat’s defence should Spurs start enjoying themselves. Louise Taylor	15/16

Heaven forbid it rains on Monday night. “But I had sympathy for Steve because I know how it works,” said Bilic. “That wasn’t just a normal game, but he has recovered really well.” His Newcastle await a first win since his return to the Premier League though West Ham’s unpredictability, without a home point to date under Bilic, may work in their favour. Just to add to the intrigue, the hosts may have Andy Carroll back in the squad after injury. Dominic Fifield	15/16

It is important, though, especially with local rivals West Brom arriving without showing a hint of attacking threat against Southampton last week. Alan Smith	15/16

Despite having earned praise for their handsome approach, they are still without a home win or a clean sheet in the Premier League and were humbled 3-1 by fellow promoted side Norwich at Carrow Road last weekend. Sunderland have only two points from five games but will doubtless take confidence from their display in the narrow 1-0 defeat at Tottenham. Ben Fisher	15/16

These sides had contrasting fortunes in the Champions League in midweek and, while Arsenal will arrive with Petr Cech in their ranks and last month’s success in the Community Shield to bolster confidence, José Mourinho will spy an opportunity. His side breezed beyond Maccabi Tel Aviv with his players finally finding some upbeat rhythm, while Arsenal only returned home from Zagreb as dawn approached on Thursday. The hosts have awkward decisions to make over John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic, but Mourinho will be confident his team will be more recognisable as reigning champions. Dominic Fifield	15/16

Five wins, five clean sheets, 11 goals and 15 points means West Ham United will be wary on arrival at the Etihad Stadium. Yet Slaven Bilic’s team have already defeated Arsenal (2-0) and Liverpool (3-0) on their travels so it could be a tough afternoon for the hosts. Jamie Jackson	15/16

A combination of some encouraging performances and a set of tough opening fixtures have, so far, kept the fans on the new manager’s side, but the defeat at West Ham looked a return to last season’s bad old ways. Another stumble could see Gallowgate Enders struggling to keep the faith. Louise Taylor	15/16

When will Leicester’s surge slow? Claudio Ranieri’s side continued their fine start by coming from 2-0 down to beat Aston Villa and will be confident on Saturday. Last year’s meetings were both decided by a single goal. Alan Smith	15/16

With a fully fit squad to choose from, Garry Monk will be hoping to put last week’s reverse at the hands of Watford behind the Swans. Barry Glendenning	15/16

Liverpool have been prolific in this fixture in recent years, scoring five in three of the past four meetings, but that was when Luis Suárez was destroying them. Alex Neil’s team may now also be a different proposition. Defeat at Southampton last month was Norwich’s first in 15 away games under the Scot.Andy Hunter	15/16

Whichever one gets the job is likely to be tested by Sadio Mané and Dusan Tadic – pass that test and United will stand a strong chance of gaining three points at St Mary’s for the second successive season in a row after last term’s slightly fortunate victory.

Victory in the Europa League will at least have given Spurs some confidence after drawing their first two games of the season at home, although Palace have been outstanding on the road under Alan Pardew and will fancy their chances of a ninth away win in 11 since he joined the club in January.

The besieged manager accepts he is in a precarious position after an alarming spell and not even the visit of a team who have four defeats from five league games offers encouragement. Aston Villa have won two and drawn two of their past four visits to Anfield, accelerated Liverpool’s problems last season with victory in the FA Cup semi-final and have clear anxiety to capitalise upon. Rodgers’ injury problems have mounted with Christian Benteke, Roberto Firmino and Dejan Lovren joining the absentee list this week. Andy Hunter	15/16

Anthony Martial may make his second Premier League start as the 19-year-old striker looks for a fifth goal in five appearances for the club. Sunderland are bottom with two points, zero victories and have conceded 13 goals while scoring six. United, then, should record their fifth win of the term. Jamie Jackson	15/16

Newcastle’s beleaguered manager, Steve McClaren, would dearly love to have Rémy available to him as his side continue to struggle for goals, a situation not helped by Papiss Cissé’s injury. Aleksandar Mitrovic is back after a ban of his own and will lead the home attack in place of Cissé – if the fiesty Serb can keep his temper under control, he has the potential talent to ease the pressure on McClaren.

Before the start of the campaign a home game against Bournemouth would have been seen as an ideal opportunity to get back on course but the newly promoted side have proven anything but a pushover so far despite the loss of two of their biggest signings, Max Gradel and Tyrone Mings, to long-term injuries.

They were favourites in both defeats this season, against Leicester and Bournemouth, and have thus far revelled when the underdog.

But they have lost their past two in the league, while Watford have won theirs. Alan Pardew has admitted the Hornets “have handled the division very well” thus far, adding that “I’ve always liked them” and “I’m a big fan of Elton John”. Simon Burnton	15/16

Tony Pulis has had notable success in stifling Roberto Martínez’s tactics in the past and the Everton manager believes his team are facing “one of the best defensive units in the Premier League”. Everton’s defensive record is not too shabby away from home this season – they are yet to concede on the road in the Premier League. Andy Hunter	15/16

This is a huge game. Villa are 18th and Stoke, who got their first win of the season last week, are two points above them. Jacob Steinberg	15/16

As injuries stack up for Eddie Howe, the spotlight will turn to Glenn Murray, the former Crystal Palace forward, to fill the void left by Wilson. Bournemouth supporters will switch their attentions to Mick Cunningham after 55 minutes, in which they will start a minute’s applause in memory of the former club photographer, who collapsed whilst at work during the first half at Stoke. The Hornets ought to know what to expect on the south coast, having duelled with the Cherries for the Championship title last year. They arrive boosted by the news that Ikechi Anya signed a five-year contract at Vicarage Road on Thursday. Ben Fisher	15/16

They lost to Porto in midweek, have a manager who can’t stop picking fights with practically everyone at the club and remain without their star striker in Diego Costa. The visitors arrive fresh from beating Swansea 3-1 and should feel they can add to the champions’ woes by recording their first win at Stamford Bridge since January 2002. Sachin Nakrani	15/16

The usually tight West Brom have conceded six goals in their last two matches and their chances of shoring things up this weekend are not helped by personnel problems in defence. Palace tend to be more dangerous away than at home but this looks like a match where the hosts will prevail. Paul Doyle	15/16

Steve McClaren’s side will be boosted by their 2-2 draw with Chelsea last time out at St James’ Park. But the way the Magpies sacrificed a 2-0 lead will have been noted, the Sky Blues will hope to prey on this fragility. Jamie Jackson	15/16

Now the aim is to put a run of home wins together; Bournemouth were beaten at Carrow Road last month and the outcome of Saturday’s match may hinge on how Leicester City respond to Arsenal’s emphatic bursting of their bubble last Saturday. Two attack-minded teams should produce a high-tempo, if at times untidy, spectacle. Nick Ames	15/16

Lose again and questions about Dick Advocaat’s future will resurface as Sunderland head into another international break without a win. Re-energised and remodelled under Slaven Bilic, West Ham appear awkward opponents, and locals will dread the prospect of their old enemy Andy Carroll stepping off the bench and scoring the winner.

Arsenal suffered once more in the Champions League in midweek and will be looking to recover immediately through the ever-dangerous Alexis Sánchez. Per Mertesacker’s rustiness, however, could prove fatal for the Gunners’ chances. Graham Searles	15/16

Rodgers has not lost a derby at Goodison Park and Daniel Sturridge’s return should improve Liverpool’s finishing. Roberto Martínez’s side, however, look far more mature this season with Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku improving. Andy Hunter	15/16

Tottenham, however, are without their influential summer signing Son Heung-min and could struggle if Swansea come out of their slump and play their usual brand of possession football.

The focus is now drawn to the visit of Aston Villa as the latest opportunity to kickstart a campaign. Tim Sherwood arrives with his own problems, and tension mounting behind the scenes with his job apparently in jeopardy. Something has to give at Stamford Bridge, with one of these managers likely to depart fearing the worst. Dominic Fifield	15/16

His Palace team have won their last three games and sit fourth while West Ham, sixth, have not lost an away game in the league and may have an extra option among the substitutes as Andy Carroll nears full fitness.

As Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth have shown they can compete at this level, in what is their first season in the top flight, expect an entertaining contest. The hope for Pellegrini is that his side do not suffer any further injuries before the Champions League visit of Sevilla. Jamie Jackson	15/16

Leicester have lost only once in the league to sit an unlikely fifth, but Southampton’s unbeaten away record has not been replicated at St Mary’s, something they will aim to put right on Saturday, despite the loss of the striker Shane Long to a foot injury.

Finally, however, it is time for Jürgen Klopp to take charge of Liverpool. It will be fascinating to see how the German lines up his team against in-form opponents, with Thursday’s loss of Danny Ings to a season-ending injury likely to have affected his plans late on. Regardless, expect a positive start from the men in red. Sachin Nakrani	15/16

Yet drive is exactly what they need before Tuesday’s vital Champions League meeting with Bayern Munich. Watford beware: their visitors have won seven of their past eight away Premier League games.

While Allardyce might settle for a clean sheet as he tries to stabilise Sunderland, Pulis needs to show far more ambition than at Crystal Palace two weeks ago. Both sides look like being in a long relegation battle so can ill afford to lose to the other even at this stage of the season. Paul Doyle	15/16

Alex Neil’s promoted team have not won in the league for a month now and they would be disappointed not to exacerbate the Tyneside misery surrounding Newcastle’s worst start to a season for 117 years. McClaren is desperate to register a first top-flight victory but could have done without needing to field Rob Elliot, his third-choice goalkeeper, after Tim Krul’s season-ending knee injury.

Xherdan Shaqiri has shaken off a thigh strain but the game has come too soon for Ryan Shawcross and Stoke will also be without Mame Biram Diouf, who is on compassionate leave following the death of his mother. Kyle Naughton returns for Swansea after missing the Tottenham game to be at the birth of his daughter. Stuart James	15/16

But having ended Bayern Munich’s 100% start to the season on Tuesday, even the most pessimistic supporters must be confident. Roberto Martínez’s side are not Bayern, although they will be looking for a response having been soundly beaten by Manchester United last Saturday and could make their opponents pay if any complacency creeps in.

After five successive league defeats, the Villa manager runs the risk of being out of a job if that run stretches to six. In the opposite dugout is Garry Monk, who was on the same FAW Uefa pro licence course as Sherwood and could do with a win himself – Swansea have not tasted victory since beating Manchester United at the end of August. Both managers have the privilege of fully fit squads to choose from. Stuart James	15/16

Palace will miss their suspended striker, Dwight Gayle, but will be keen to bounce back after their disappointing home defeat to West Ham last Saturday. Graham Searles	15/16

That defensive horror show would have given City’s manager, Alex Neil, a long week, even if Saturday’s visitors were beaten 3-0 in the Capital One Cup last month. Tony Pulis’s side are unlikely to be as charitable again. Paul Chronnell	15/16

Despite being comparatively strong in defence, Quique Sánchez Flores’s side could struggle against Stoke who are building up a quiet head of steam after Monday’s win at Swansea. If victorious on Saturday Stoke should move into the top half of the table. Graham Searles	15/16

The champions have relieved the pressure on them in the past week, beating Aston Villa 2-0 last Saturday and drawing 0-0 at Dynamo Kyiv on Tuesday. Two clean sheets have boosted confidence at the back. Yet the visit to Upton Park could be awkward for José Mourinho. West Ham are fourth and Slaven Bilic’s side have already beaten Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City. Jacob Steinberg	15/16

That said, they are unbeaten in the Premier League since the opening day. Yet, given the visitors’ venture to Brussels on Thursday in the Europa League, these are the fixtures Bournemouth should target as an opportunity. The last few weeks, as the implications of long-term injuries are felt, have been damaging. Eddie Howe will hope this occasion will revitalise his own side’s challenge. Dominic Fifield	15/16

While Ronald Koeman will share the German’s sentiments after his Southampton side spurned a 2-0 lead at Leicester last Saturday, with a visit to Chelsea next weekend it is Klopp who needs to find the winning habit.

If Manuel Pellegrini can earn a 50th victory for City their lead over United will stretch to five points and a significant psychological blow will have been dealt. But with David Silva and Sergio Agüero out and Louis van Gaal’s side playing at home, United are surely favourites despite the manager’s protestations to the contrary. Jamie Jackson	15/16

He aims to secure not only the Wearsiders’ sixth straight win against their neighbours but also his side’s first league victory of the season. Standing in the way are Steve McClaren’s visiting team, fresh from demolishing Norwich 6-2. Much may hinge on a feisty looking central midfield battle potentially pitting Yann M’Vila and Lee Cattermole against Cheik Tioté and Sunderland old boy Jack Colback. Louise Taylor	15/16

Forget for a moment the antipathy which grew between the clubs during the Portuguese’s first spell in England: since he returned to Chelsea in 2013 there has been that Steven Gerrard slip at Anfield and an acrimonious League Cup semi-final at Stamford Bridge. Now the hosts appear vulnerable, languishing in 15th place with pressure mounting on the manager. Jürgen Klopp, bolstered by a first win at his new club in midweek, could lay down a marker in south-west London at Mourinho’s expense. Dominic Fifield	15/16

United’s no-thrills style remains a bone of contention, although not to Van Gaal. “Sticks and stones,” he says of the criticism. It is the results that matter and United, he argues, are improving. “United lull the stadium and take the positivity out of it by keeping possession,” Alan Pardew said. The Palace manager meant away stadiums. David Hytner	15/16

They have scored 18 goals in their six games in all competitions since, five of which have been won. Manuel Pellegrini’s side are once more flying as they were before that 4-1 defeat to Spurs. Norwich City are not – they last enjoyed victory on 23 September and have lost their past three Premier League matches. There is, then, surely only one winner at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Jamie Jackson	15/16

The captain is available here after that red card was rescinded but Steve McClaren’s team will not find it easy against Stoke, who will be buoyed by beating Chelsea on penalties in midweek and with five wins from their past six in all competitions.

Swansea’s Garry Monk has no such worries with his full squad available, but is hoping to improve on a run of one win in their past six league games. Paul Chronnell	15/16

Watford, buoyed by a convincing win at Stoke and the possible return from injury of José Manuel Jurado, hope to prolong the Hammers’ record of upside-down achievement. Simon Burnton	15/16

His relationship with Riyad Mahrez has been one of the season’s great joys so far. Claudio Ranieri, the Leicester manager, made 10 changes for the penalty shootout defeat to Hull in the League Cup but could name the same team that beat Crystal Palace in last weekend’s league game.

The Bournemouth manager has urged his team to put on a true home performance – defeat for either side would leave them in the relegation zone over the international break. Ben Fisher	15/16

Football is a results business first and last and the manager is doing fine in this department. The club is re-established as a challenger for the Premier League, and they also lead their Champions League group, after the midweek win over CSKA Moscow. In last season’s corresponding fixture at Old Trafford, West Brom beat United 1-0 so there should not be too many complaints if they win ugly. Again. Jamie Jackson	15/16

Defeat to Swansea would be their fifth in a row, but the Welsh side have won only one of their past seven so this would appear a good opportunity to start looking towards the mid-table positions once more. An injury to the in-form loanee Matt Jarvis is a particular blow to Alex Neil while the defence will be rejigged with the captain, Russell Martin, suspended. Nick Ames	15/16

Will Chelsea build on Wednesday’s win against Dynamo Kyiv or will they suffer yet another damaging loss, and against a team who have already beaten them in the Capital One Cup this season?

That system failure increases the pressure on Sunderland to register what would be only their second Premier League win of the season at Southampton’s expense.

However it is 22 years since their last win at the ground, so they will still be braced for an awkward afternoon. José Mourinho has had a fortnight to stew over the loss at Stoke, a third league defeat in succession, which he watched from the team’s hotel. Still backed by the club’s hierarchy, who have promised to be even more supportive, he will be back on the touchline on Saturday seeking a reaction and a step forward on the road to recovery.

Small wonder Tynesiders are keeping everything crossed that Vardy’s extraordinary scoring streak is halted – temporarily at least – by the hip injury that leaves him touch and go for Saturday. With Leicester supreme on the counterattack, Claudio Ranieri aims to continue confounding the doubters but Steve McClaren is confident his Newcastle side are “turning a corner”. Louise Taylor	15/16

Ronald Koeman will have his work cut out against Stoke, though. Mark Hughes’s side have been much improved since Ryan Shawcross’s return, beating Chelsea before the international break at the Britannia Stadium. Jonathan Walters is fresh from firing Ireland into Euro 2016 and Hughes will hope he can reproduce that form on Saturday. Graham Searles	15/16

Monk, who has a fully-fit squad to choose from, may be suffering from the raised expectations generated by last season’s record points haul. Bournemouth have lacked a cutting edge since Callum Wilson’s serious knee injury and Eddie Howe needs Joshua King to fill the void in the attacking third. Rich Flower	15/16

Wayne Rooney, Anthony Martial and Marouane Fellaini are injured, while Louis van Gaal says that James Wilson is not ready to play 90 minutes, and United’s list of absentees will boost Watford’s hopes of pulling off a famous win. United’s defence will not relish the task of containing Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo. Jacob Steinberg	15/16

But Albion fans are growing impatient with the negativity on display from their team so far this season. An enterprising performance and victory over Arsenal would be ideally timed, and Arsenal’s injury problems may help. But Arsène Wenger’s side have shown steel as well as style this season and it is difficult to see them slipping up at The Hawthorns. Paul Doyle	15/16

After all, Crystal Palace come into it having beaten Liverpool at Anfield prior to the international break while Sunderland lost again, this time to Southampton. Sam Allardyce feels his team are “playing with fear” and he must hope memories of winning 3-1 at Selhurst Park last season can provide them with a shot of confidence. Sachin Nakrani	15/16

It remains to be seen whether the banishment of Grealish, one of the brightest prospects in a struggling side, will serve to galvanise the youngster but Watford will surely be glad he is absent for such a crucial game near the foot of the table.

It leaves only Aston Villa beneath them in the table and with Chelsea and Manchester United after this another defeat could leave them in dire straits. Everton are big favourites to complete a south coast double having dismantled Southampton earlier in the season. Romelu Lukaku has seven goals from as many games and Roberto Martínez’s team have 11 in their last three, so expect goals. Alan Smith	15/16

Marouane Chamakh came on in that one and is an option again after injury while Newcastle, who have not lost to Palace since 1998, should have Jack Colback available again. Mark Tallentire	15/16

Louis van Gaal has described Vardy as a “nasty” problem for Manchester United and a “great” player but he will be just as wary of the threat posed by the in-form Riyad Mahrez. United have the meanest defence in the top flight so a repeat of last season’s 5-3 win for Leicester would appear unlikely. Rich Flower	15/16

Southampton have two victories from their past three top-flight games and know this is a chance to narrow the deficit on their third-placed opponents to three points. Given the three steps forward one step back nature of this City team it would be no surprise if Ronald Koeman’s side departed with the spoils. Jamie Jackson	15/16

By keeping clean sheets in Stoke’s past five away games in all competitions, the goalkeeper has already equalled it and now hopes to create a bit of history. With survival Sunderland’s sole concern, Sam Allardyce is expected to retain his new, opponent smothering, 3-5-2 formation. Considering Mark Hughes’s otherwise impressive team often struggle to score, the thrill factor could be on the low side. Louise Taylor	15/16

Klopp has called for Liverpool to bring the devastating form that mauled Manchester City last weekend home with them. He is yet to taste a Premier League victory at Anfield but five wins from six matches in all competitions suggests the wait will not continue for long. Andy Hunter	15/16

Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez were in top form as they bounced back to beat Dinamo Zagreb at home on Tuesday and they ought to have too much for a Norwich team that has endured a very difficult past two months.

There was little sympathy from José Mourinho for their plight, the Chelsea manager pointing to the unforgiving schedule around the Champions League semi-final against Atlético Madrid in 2014. In truth, the Portuguese has his own problems with John Terry and Ramires to be assessed on Saturday after picking up injuries in Israel in midweek. Dominic Fifield	15/16

Last week’s mauling at Tottenham was certainly chastening and Slaven Bilic, shorn of his most creative player, Dimitri Payet, is also without his suspended captain Mark Noble against an Albion side buoyed by beating Arsenal 2-1.

Allardyce has tightened Sunderland up, led them to morale-boosting victories and he will ask a simple question of Arsenal – ‘Can you break us down?’ The animosity between the two has cooled but there is still no love lost.

Should Artur Boruc not prove his fitness then Ryan Allsop will start in goal with the teenager Jordan Holmes on the bench. The Australian was playing on loan with Weymouth in front of 349 fans at Hemel Hempstead last Saturday.

West Ham United have beaten Arsenal, Liverpool and City on the road, and Chelsea at home. The success of Van Gaal’s team is built on a Scrooge-like defence, while Slaven Bilic’s men are unfazed by playing more heralded names. This could be a draw. Jamie Jackson	15/16

If Rémi Garde’s side are to inflict more pain on the Saints rather than extend their own hapless streak, then Adam Traoré, their lone shining light in last week’s defeat by Watford, will probably have to excel.

On recent evidence, maybe not. Garry Monk’s team have not kept a clean sheet since drawing with Everton on 19 September, though their biggest worry at present is finding their opposition’s goal.

However, Alex Neil will also be aware his side have won just once on the road in seven attempts this season.

After presiding over only two league wins all season, Newcastle’s manager acknowledges he is in the dark about his precarious looking future on Tyneside and is unlikely to be cheered by memories of the last time he met Klopp. In 2011 a Bundesliga win for the German’s Dortmund side at McClaren’s Wolfsburg proved the Englishman’s penultimate game in charge before his sacking.

The only team to have beaten Jürgen Klopp at Anfield this season have won their last two visits to Goodison Park 3-2 and confidence will not be an issue after their 5-1 trouncing of Newcastle United last weekend. Everton, who will give a late fitness test to James McCarthy, may have advanced into the Capital One Cup semi-finals in midweek but the two points dropped at Bournemouth still hurt Roberto Martínez. His team need a response. Andy Hunter	15/16

If the Dutchman thought the goalless draw with West Ham was bad, he entered a whole new level of Old Trafford despair following defeat at Wolfsburg and a Champions League exit. However, United remain three points off the top but know that Bournemouth, buoyed by their fine win at Chelsea, could complete a quite miserable week. Paul Chronnell	15/16

They have won their last seven league games against Crystal Palace, matches played in the top two divisions, and cost Neil Warnock his job with a 3-1 success in south London a year ago. Yet they arrive amid a dip in form and Alan Pardew’s team will offer more of a test, particularly as they look to build upon last month’s 5-1 thrashing of Newcastle and improve upon their own indifferent home record. The return of Wilfried Zaha from suspension will add to their armoury, with this a reunion with former employers for Pardew, José Fonte and Jason Puncheon. Dominic Fifield	15/16

This means Manuel Pellegrini’s team face an unknown proposition: the state of flux could be an advantage to them, or Swansea may be doubly determined to win this game for Monk. Either way following the fine midweek 4-2 victory over Borussia Mönchengladbach City will expect to draw level with the leaders Leicester, who are not in action until Monday evening’s visit of Chelsea.

They visit Manchester United and Tottenham after this and Alex Neil could do with a performance against Everton that renders his attacking players, in particular, undroppable. He has chopped and changed in recent weeks without finding an effective combination; whoever is selected for this assignment should take heart that, at the worst, Roberto Martínez’s side usually give you a chance.

However, West Ham’s momentum has stalled. They have not won since beating Chelsea on 24 October and could be missing six key players, while Stoke will be confident after last weekend’s comprehensive victory over Manchester City.

On the face of it there looks only one winner. Aston Villa, for whom Jack Grealish is back in contention after a spell on the naughty step, have gone a club-record 14 league games without a win and look nailed-on relegation candidates. Arsenal, on the other hand, ought to be oozing confidence after their emphatic midweek victory over Olympiakos. Stuart James	15/16

They will be without Daniel Sturridge after he strained his hamstring at Newcastle. However, the in-form playmaker Philippe Coutinho could return to the starting lineup following his cameo from the bench in the Europa League against an Albion side sure to concede possession as they look to make it four consecutive league games without defeat.

McClaren feels a little more secure, after his players produced a performance of hard running and focus, but it does not get any easier for him. Tottenham, unbeaten in 14 matches, have been outrun by very few opponents. David Hytner	15/16

Together Vardy and Mahrez have found the net seven times more than Chelsea this season, while Willian is the player José Mourinho will look to for inspiration at the other end. Chris McMullan	15/16

They desperately need a win against opponents who also find themselves in relegation strife and the suspicion is that with Guus Hiddink poised to take over on a temporary basis again, the hosts will rise to the occasion now the man who accused them of a “betrayal” has left.

Robert Huth, Danny Drinkwater and Jeffrey Schlupp will all be absent against an Everton team that is pleasing on the eye but not satisfying supporters with recent results.

It could be scrappy, ugly and even achieved in the pedestrian style many Manchester United supporters have come to detest. To cast Norwich City in the role of easy victims is wrong.

Despite successive, morale-boosting wins against Liverpool and Spurs, Steve McClaren’s side remain vulnerable and will surely need to modify their recent counterattacking strategy against Garde’s side. Villa, though, have now gone 15 League games without victory. A few more stumbles and the Championship will be within touching distance. Louise Taylor	15/16

Another defeat or two could see them looking over their shoulders and Ronald Koeman will be hoping that Graziano Pellè, who had an injection to his injured knee, will be fit and perform somewhere close to his brilliant best.

Mark Hughes should have the edge, however, as Stoke beat Manchester City emphatically in their last home fixture.

Eddie Howe will not be daunted by visiting The Hawthorns after such great results but Tony Pulis will have prepared West Brom accordingly to try to halt their progression. The fact the visitors concede more than two goals per game on the road could prove a telling statistic. Graham Searles	15/16

Slaven Bilic’s attacking replacements have not been able to fill the void left by Dimitri Payet, in particular, but Bilic should still be faithful against Swansea, who have not won in their last six league games.

The Hornets have won all of their past three games – and their opponents none of theirs – and the continued absence of the hamstrung Daniel Sturridge will make the Reds’ task more difficult against a home side who have no significant injuries and have yet to lose this season against any side below them in the league.

It is surely not coincidental that the slump in form for Slaven Bilic’s side has come while Dimitri Payet has been absent with an ankle injury and his return in the new year will be welcome.

The Cherries will attempt to mute the threat of the much admired duo of Yannick Bolasie and Wilfried Zaha but they, too, possess star quality in the wide areas.

The Dutchman’s second spell in interim charge will begin with a late fitness test for Eden Hazard and a reminder to his players that fourth place is still attainable if an instant upturn in form can be instigated.

Jürgen Klopp’s men have collected only one point from the past nine available and, with Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez in town, have suffered the untimely loss of Martin Skrtel to a hamstring injury. With Dejan Lovren returning to training only on Wednesday, Klopp may have to make do with Kolo Touré and Mamadou Sakho at the heart of defence for Liverpool’s 4,000th game in the top flight.

The Sunderland manager has recalled Jeremain Lens to the squad after a disciplinary incident earlier in the month and called on the £8m signing to “prove that he’s an immense talent”, it will be interesting to see how the Dutchman responds.

Although Steve McClaren’s side have shown signs of definite improvement in recent weeks they remain fourth bottom – not great for a club whose declared pre-season target was a top eight place. Accordingly Mike Ashley, the owner, will want to see evidence that the recent mini renaissance is genuine. A lot here though could depend on how Paul Dummett copes with Everton’s Gerard Deulofeu.

They lost it 2-0 on New Year’s Day, after two Wojciech Szczesny errors, and then there was a kerfuffle about the goalkeeper smoking by the showers afterwards. And yet it was to be a turning point. Since then, Arsenal have lost only five Premier League matches and they return to St Mary’s with genuine title hopes. Southampton desperately need a tonic after a run of five losses and a draw.

United have fallen nine points off the lead and Van Gaal’s assertion that they could be top in the next four weeks seems optimistic, to say the least. Stoke, with six clean sheets in their last eight games, will be tricky opponents, but are coming off the back of a home defeat to Crystal Palace. Daniel Taylor	15/16

Sunday’s goalless draw with West Ham highlighted their biggest problem – a toothless attack. Tony Pulis’ team have failed to win in four and are without Salomón Rondón and James McClean, both of whom start three-match bans. Saido Berahino is set to start for the first time since October.

Tottenham should provide a sterner test than Louis van Gaal’s insipid Manchester United did and the fresh confidence of Alex Neil’s side will be tested. Harry Kane will be aiming to impress against the club where he spent an underwhelming loan spell in the 2012-13 season. Rich Flower	15/16

Arsenal have not lost at home since the season’s opening day and that, coupled with Arsène Wenger masterminding victories in his last eight encounters with Newcastle, makes it unlikely Steve McClaren will turn over a new leaf to begin 2016.

Jamie Vardy began his record-breaking run with a goal against Bournemouth, and will hope to add to his impressive tally. Claudio Ranieri’s side face a Bournemouth side who are in good form. Eddie Howe has coaxed the best out of his depleted squad, so could a shock be on the cards at the King Power? Martin White	15/16

Alex Neil is believed to be working on deals for Steven Naismith and the Dinamo Zagreb right-back Ivo Pinto; Norwich are certain to strengthen this month but will hope that Dieumerci Mbokani’s goal against Aston Villa on Tuesday marked the start of an overdue run of form for one of their existing front men.

Critically for Sunderland’s chances Villa will be without their solitary shining light this season, Jordan Ayew. However, Sunderland have absentees of their own at the back and could miss Sebastián Coates and John O’Shea, although that might be a blessing in disguise considering Sam Allardyce’s side have conceded a whopping 38 goals so far.

Manchester City’s goalless draw with Leicester City on Tuesday left them three points off the top and they cannot afford any complacency against Watford, who have taken four points off Chelsea and Liverpool in the past fortnight. With Vincent Kompany absent, Odion Ighalo will fancy his chances. The Watford striker has seven goals in his past six matches. Jacob Steinberg	15/16

And, as the form team, nobody would bet against them. Palace have lost only once in their previous nine games to sit fifth, although injuries and Yohan Cabaye’s ban stand to undermine them. Their compact and fast-breaking style will ask questions of Chelsea who welcome back Diego Costa from suspension. David Hytner	15/16

Everton have a dreadful record against Spurs, winning none of their last six Premier League games against them. So, Romelu Lukaku’s blistering form will need to continue to give Everton a chance. Spurs will be looking to extend their winning run to four games for the first time since January 2014, but they will have to do it without Moussa Dembélé, who has been ruled out with a groin injury.

Aston Villa very much remain in the mire, though, while Leicester, despite the goals drying up somewhat in recent weeks, have been tough to break down, keeping a clean sheet in their past three league outings. Villa led by two goals in the reverse fixture only to fall apart in the second half and concede three. Alan Smith	15/16

The hosts re-signed Lewis Grabban from Norwich on Monday, with the manager, Alex Neil, describing the striker as a worthless commodity. Grabban, who scored 35 goals in two seasons during his first spell at Bournemouth, will doubtless be keen to prove his worth again. Ben Fisher	15/16

Crystal Palace might be short of goals and lost at Aston Villa on Tuesday but they have impressed more away from home than at Selhurst Park, thanks to blistering pace on the counter, meaning City will need to be at their sharpest to return to winning ways and maintain their title challenge.

The former England coach could do with building on Tuesday’s spirited draw against Manchester United by beating his one time Croatia counterpart but West Ham have their sights on Europe – and Dimitri Payet back in midfield.

Two very different managers want the same thing – evidence of genuine improvement – as they look to close the gap on the top four.

Kyle Naughton’s suspension has been overturned, however, and is clear to play here against a side that has hit something of a slump recently, losing three and drawing one of their last four in the league.

Claudio Ranieri says he is not worried about Jamie Vardy’s seven-match run without a goal, while Riyad Mahrez has also not found the net in five having also missed two penalties. Stoke will be tough to break down and rapid on the counter. Alan Smith	15/16

Before them are a Southampton side who were beaten 3-2 in the reverse fixture and who have seven points fewer than United’s 37. Earlier this term Van Gaal’s men went 11 games unbeaten in all competitions of which only four were victories. The current sequence is five with three wins. This ratio has to continue into March at least. Jamie Jackson	15/16

Consecutive defeats have left City two points above safety but those were both away. They are undefeated in five at Carrow Road. Alex Neil might give Steven Naismith his debut after the Scotland striker’s move from Everton was confirmed. Alan Smith	15/16

With the Wearsiders seemingly averse to drawing under Allardyce’s charge much may depend on the performances of two former Bournemouth loanees, Jermain Defoe and John O’Shea in the home ranks. Both played in the same south coast team as Eddie Howe and Jason Tindall, now the visiting manager and assistant manager. Defoe even lodged with Tindall with the then defender cooking for him.

Their recent form means that for the first time since August there is some concern about their prospects this season, a wobble they will attempt to end by completing a treble over Newcastle, who have not lost in two matches since they were undeservedly beaten here in the FA Cup a fortnight ago. “It is a tough challenge to beat them again, but this is our target, to play well and replicate those good feelings,” said Quique Sánchez Flores. Watford’s record signing Nordin Amrabat should make his debut at some stage. Simon Burnton	15/16

West Bromwich are safely positioned in mid-table and despite a host of injuries to key players, leaving Tony Pulis concerned, they will be fancied to complete a league double over their neighbours for the first time in 42 years.

For City there is the opportunity to leapfrog Arsenal, and having tightened up at the back and containing Sergio Agüero in attack, the visitors will also feel confident of winning.

Four of Chelsea’s six league wins this season have come against teams in the bottom eight, with the others against a Crystal Palace side on the turn and an Arsenal lineup reduced to nine men. That loss to José Mourinho in September will still rile Wenger, though the onus is now on Guus Hiddink to prove his unbeaten six-match tenure is no false dawn. Dominic Fifield	15/16

The upshot is that the home side are still a point away from the top half of the table, the visitors just a point above the relegation positions. If new coach Francesco Guidolin is going to make a difference at the Welsh club, today would be a good time to start. Paul Wilson	15/16

However, injuries to Rudy Gestede and Libor Kozak have left Rémi Garde with just Gabriel Agbonlahor as his only fit striker. Norwich welcome Robbie Brady back as they look to end their dreadful run of losses and stay out of the relegation zone. Gregg Bakowski Kick-off Saturday 3pm	15/16

On the pitch Liverpool need the cutting edge that was notable by its absence in the midweek defeat at Leicester City. Relegation-threatened Sunderland have not won at Anfield since October 1983.

Following West Brom’s rejection of Newcastle’s £21m bid for the forward, that is probably the stuff of Steve McClaren’s nightmares. If relegation is to be avoided – and if he is to keep his job – this really looks a must-win game for the Tynesiders. That task is complicated by an injury crisis. Despite investing £80m in new players this season, McClaren has only three fit senior defenders. Louise Taylor	15/16

Ronald Koeman’s side are in rich form and will hope Austin’s predatory skills help to close some of the gap to the team above them in sixth. West Ham are hard to beat, though, and have Andy Carroll available again after recovering from injury. Gregg Bakowski	15/16

Stoke have won once in the league in 2016 and have scored once in their past five matches, while Everton are 11th despite scoring more goals than everyone apart from the top three. Mark Hughes, who could start Stoke’s record signing Giannelli Imbula, needs his attack to click, Everton need their defence to cut out the errors. Jacob Steinberg	15/16

Alan Pardew’s team have dropped from fifth to 12th place after losing five league games on the spin and their long injury list now includes the names of James McArthur and Jason Puncheon. Alberto Paloschi looks sets to make his full debut for Swansea, who will be without Ki Sung-yueng. Stuart James	15/16

To sustain that they will need the new central defensive partnership of Kevin Wimmer and Toby Alderweireld to shut out Watford’s deadly duo of Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo. That is the stiffest test Spurs have faced since the loss of Jan Vertonghen to injury and if they pass it, especially if Dele Alli is unavailale through illness, then Premier League title talk will grow.

How did that happen? And they are well aware that they face a stern test at Dean Court. Bournemouth, who have been pepped up front by former Arsenal trainee Benik Afobe, have won five of their past 10 league games and Arsène Wenger is among those who are convinced that they will stay up. “They have enough substance in their game,” Wenger said.

Louis van Gaal can still aspire to achieve that via the domestic league. Guus Hiddink may have to target claiming a European Cup to leave his team competing for another. His side’s 10-match unbeaten run masks the reality they have yet to win a Premier League game at Stamford Bridge since he rejoined the club. This would be a fine moment to break that duck.

Eddie Howe, in contrast, has steered his side away from the relegation zone and a win here could edge them closer to mid-table and within two points of Mark Hughes’s side.

Yet the visitors have bolstered their ranks and will pose a different kind of threat at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea forever seem to be striving to salvage games.

But while Palace ended a run of five successive defeats last week with a point at Swansea, Watford have also stuttered having picked up only four points from their last six matches. Both sides will be therefore be desperate for a victory, although Palace’s need is probably greater. They will have to do it without Yannick Bolasie, who is due to return next week, while Watford will hope Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney can rediscover their scoring touches having failed to find the net in four of their last five matches.

West Brom, in stark contrast, are without a win in their last five in the league and there is serious danger that Tony Pulis’s side will become embroiled in the battle to avoid relegation. West Brom are still short of options in defence, with Gareth McAuley out with a hamstring problem.

They take on an upwardly mobile West Ham side that will inevitably be buoyed by their dramatic FA Cup victory over Liverpool in midweek. To add to Norwich’s frustrations, midfielder Alex Tettey is suspended. However, West Ham have issues of their own to deal with as Cheikhou Kouyaté, Winston Reid and Joey O’Brien all miss out. The Norwich winger Matt Jarvis will hope for an opportunity to impress against his former side, with Neil’s side in need of attacking inspiration. Jeorge Bird	15/16

As if a relegation struggle was not bad enough, the Wearside club sacked Adam Johnson, their former England winger on Thursday night. Allardyce and Van Gaal failed to see eye to eye last season when the then West Ham manager left the Dutchman incensed after accusing Manchester United of “throwing long balls into the box” to secure a late 1-1 draw at Upton Park.

Ki Sung-yueng could return for them and the on-loan Leroy Fer is keen for a debut in front of his manager at Feyenoord, Ronald Koeman. Mark Tallentire	15/16

Maybe, after all Arsène Wenger is the only manager so far to make Leicester look like the side that were bottom for much of last season. Arsenal, therefore, should be confident they can repeat the display and cut Leicester’s lead at the top in front of their own fans. However, Claudio Ranieri will surely be plotting another dazzling away win to keep his side on track for title glory. Graham Searles	15/16

With Philippe Coutinho, Daniel Sturridge and Divock Origi back from injury, Roberto Firmino scoring five goals in his last six outings and Christian Benteke anxious to face his former club, Jürgen Klopp finally has options to exploit Aston Villa’s weaknesses. But, as he admitted: “It is not a coincidence we are ninth and Villa are where they are.” Andy Hunter	15/16

This might not kill their title hopes but would certainly leave them moribund, so the solution is simple, though difficult to achieve: beat Mauricio Pochettino’s men. City’s ambitions should be boosted by Vincent Kompany’s return following a long-standing calf injury. Jamie Jackson	15/16

Alex Neil’s side have conceded 18 and taken just one point from their past six games. Expecting victory should always be avoided but Ranieri can be sure Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy have the quality to maintain Leicester’s two-point advantage at the top. Graham Searles	15/16

However, if Chelsea can build on their impressive Cup demolition of Manchester City last Sunday then Guus Hiddink should expect a positive outcome. Ronald Koeman, meanwhile, will believe his compatriot is vulnerable and St Mary’s can witness a fifth straight home win. Graham Searles	15/16

Rémi Garde has Rudy Gestede and Gabriel Agbonlahor fit again but an ailing defence will be tested by a Stoke side that, bolstered by new arrival Giannelli Imbula, looked to have recovered their potency in the win at Bournemouth.

Quique Sánchez Flores will be the happier of the two, though, as his side close in on securing top-flight status – if they win on Saturday, they will have 39 points. Meanwhile, Eddie Howe needs to spark Bournemouth into life after three successive defeats, the most recent in the FA Cup. Graham Searles	15/16

West Brom’s restorative win at Everton before the FA Cup shenanigans at Reading was a big boost for Tony Pulis’s team, while Palace’s league form has been diabolical. They have not won since the turn of the year, losing six of their last nine. But can they build on their Cup win at Tottenham? Alan Smith	15/16

West Ham have a habit of dropping points when the Champions League places move into view but victory here might exert some pressure on those above; Allardyce’s Sunderland, on the other hand can take encouragement from an improved run of February performances and the manager’s face will be a picture if his side have earned three vital points to aid their relegation fight.

Tottenham slipped up last weekend in the FA Cup against Crystal Palace but they are in a rare grove while Swansea have found goals hard to come by and they remain perched above the relegation places. Under Guidolin, they have stabilised but title-chasing Tottenham are determined to make no mistakes. David Hytner	15/16

The feat would mark an excellent seven days for Louis van Gaal. Arsène Wenger’s side have lost and drawn their past two matches but neither of these were in the league, and given Arsenal are two points behind Leicester City after beating them before the FA Cup round, victory is necessary to continue their push for title glory.

How times change. The London club are now in excellent form and the man in charge, Guus Hiddink, can do no wrong. Stoke will prove a stern test, however, and should sense they can win at Stamford Bridge for the first time since 1974, especially as John Terry remains out injured. Sachin Nakrani	15/16

We are one point behind with 10 games to go so we have a chance”. Everton, eight points further back, have no such hope and it will take a flourish over the final few months for this not to be regarded as a season of underachievement.

If Manuel Pellegrini cannot rouse City to beat Aston Villa then hopes of winning the title will surely be all but lost. Rémi Garde, meanwhile, could be forgiven for dreading his side’s visit to the Etihad and the proposition of being cut further adrift at the foot of the table. Graham Searles	15/16

Some suspect this may be his last stand as manager but he remains optimistic he can confound the doubters by leading his team out of the bottom three. Bournemouth, though, will be anxious to exert revenge for a slightly flukey Newcastle win on the south coast earlier in the season. Fabricio Coloccini is still injured, so Jonjo Shelvey continues as the home captain with his manager hoping the England midfielder can bring much needed “edge” to the role. Louise Taylor	15/16

They have won just two games on the road in this campaign and will be without midfield enforcer Lee Cattermole through a concussion. Ronald Koeman will miss his hamstrung striker Charlie Austin, while Shane Long must also sit this one out. Barry Glendenning	15/16

Francesco Guidolin will not be present on the touchline again but his side should be very confident they can inflict another defeat on struggling Norwich.

In fact, this is the biggest north London derby in recent memory. As Arsène Wenger remarked, never before in his 19 and a half years at Arsenal has this showdown stood to shape the title race. Tottenham slipped up at West Ham in midweek but their belief is strong and they are favourites. Arsenal’s form has deserted them and another defeat does not bear thinking about for Wenger.

The Brazilian goalkeeper will have to excel if the hosts are to disrupt Leicester’s progress towards the title, especially if Odion Ighalo’s six-game goal drought continues. Paul Doyle	15/16

They have not beaten Palace in the league at Selhurst since 1997 but the Eagles are in freefall. Had the Premier League season begun on New Year’s Day Alan Pardew’s side would be bottom of the table.

They are 10 points behind Leicester City as West Brom welcome them, having won their past three matches. Tony Pulis’s side held Claudio Ranieri’s leaders to a draw on Tuesday and will be a tough proposition for Louis van Gaal’s side. This may end in a draw. Jamie Jackson	15/16

It still might be but Bournemouth have taken an impressive haul of seven points from their last three matches while Swansea have won their last two. Swansea will still be without head coach Francesco Guidolin, who continues to recover from a chest infection. First-team coach Alan Curtis will again deputise in the dugout. Ben Fisher	15/16

Victory cannot be delayed much longer though and Alex Neil’s side might not wish to dwell on the fact that their woeful league run was prefaced, back in January, by a 3-0 FA Cup defeat at Carrow Road to Manchester City. Victory for the away side would apply a degree of pressure on the title chasers above them, and this looks like a game neither team can really afford to lose. Nick Ames	15/16

So Mark Hughes will welcome Southampton to the Britannia as he endeavours to better last season’s record 54-point haul. Ronald Koeman can only hope his defence remains resolute and that Graziano Pellè finally finds the net once more as the Italian’s goal drought stretches back to the beginning of November.

Aston Villa should, on the face of it, be obliging opponents for Spurs and it is tempting to wonder if Pochettino could have rested players for this fixture, against the Premier League’s bottom club, and picked a stronger side in Dortmund. Either way Spurs need to get back on track after winning only two of their last seven in all competitions. Stuart James	15/16

That said, expectations will be low on Tyneside, so an unlikely positive result could prove hugely beneficial to Newcastle’s hopes of staying in the Premier League. Claudio Ranieri, meanwhile, will see victory as a must as their closest threat, Tottenham, should earn three points against Aston Villa. Graham Searles	15/16

Chelsea are nine points behind West Ham United, who are two points off the top four, and have a selection headache with Diego Costa suspended. Nonetheless, Bilic is wary of their threat and West Ham will need to be at their best to win at Stamford Bridge for the first time since 2002. Jacob Steinberg	15/16

Alan Pardew’s side have belied their struggles to reach the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 21 years and, with Yannick Bolasie back on form, Palace could be a potential banana skin for the Foxes. Claudio Ranieri had a sausage, of all things, named after him this week by a local butcher but the Leicester manager knows this is no time to take anything for granted. Ed Aarons	15/16

At least they will not be facing Messi, Suárez, Neymar and co when they arrive at Everton, who have won only one of the past 17 league meetings between the sides and lost seven times already at home in the Premier League this season.

Another three points will take the Welsh club to 36 and surely put any lingering relegation fears to bed. André Ayew is sidelined with an ankle injury but Gylfi Sigurdsson is in fine form and Swansea will be confident of picking up a third win in four matches. As for Aston Villa, they have lost their last five and need a minor miracle. Stuart James	15/16

Quique Sánchez Flores’s side will now look to turn around their league form having only won one of their last six. Stoke City travel to Vicarage Road having lost for the first time in five games last week against Southampton and Mark Hughes will know returning to winnings ways will be tough against Watford’s staunch defence.

The run has moved them away from danger at the bottom, whereas Norwich City are still deep in trouble.

This would also boost their bid to ensure a top-four finish and overhaul the faltering Arsenal, who are third. After United’s exit from the Europa League at Liverpool’s hands, Louis van Gaal could do without a defeat and as this is the story of his season, expect little to change regarding his employment.

If the Big Sam-Rafa technical subplot promises edginess, Rafael Benítez is more concerned with marking his first home game in charge of Newcastle by ending Sunderland’s run of six straight derby wins. By peculiar coincidence, four of those victories saw Sunderland under the charge of a new manager presiding over his second game after losing the first. Can Benítez emulate Paolo Di Canio, Gus Poyet, Dick Advocaat and Allardyce? Louise Taylor	15/16

But Southampton have tightened up since then and, with Graziano Pellè back on the goal trail and Sadio Mané having had his red card rescinded, they have the firepower to pursue their own European ambitions.

Eddie Howe’s side are mid-table, virtually safe, unbeaten away from home in 2016 and have won their last three matches. The hosts will restore Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen, Mousa Dembélé and their full-back pairing and hope they hit the ground running. Last Sunday’s win at Villa Park has eased a few nerves, but now is the time for Mauricio Pochettino’s side to generate real momentum. Dominic Fifield	15/16

Arsenal need victory to stay in the top four – and to keep any possible title hopes alive. These sides met at the Emirates only three weeks ago in the FA Cup, when Watford worked incredibly hard to knock out an Arsenal side that looked far too complacent on the day. Arthur Renard	15/16

No. They are 12 points adrift of safety with seven games to go but have long looked resigned to relegation. It makes this early kick-off something of a nothing game. Chelsea have a nine-point gap to sixth, perhaps making it an ideal time for Guus Hiddink to give a portion of the club’s youngsters some minutes. Alan Smith	15/16

After losing to Manchester United before the international break, City’s hopes of securing a top-four finish suddenly look precarious, with in-form West Ham United breathing down their necks. Bournemouth travelled to Dubai for a five-day training camp over the international break and Eddie Howe is keen for the home side to perform after a 5-1 defeat at the Etihad in October. “It’s not one we just want to host and put on a show for them, we want to give them a really good game,” said Howe.

The visitors have won only one of their last 21 league trips to Liverpool and have collected nine points from the last 63 available at Anfield. But with Harry Kane one goal short of a Premier League record for Spurs and Dele Alli confronting the club that neglected to sign him, Mauricio Pochettino has the talent to make a significant statement of intent.

That will be particularly true for the goalkeeper – probably Karl Darlow – drafted into the Newcastle line-up to replace the injured Rob Elliot. None of Norwich’s strikers have scored regularly this season but whichever of them is deployed by Alex Neil is sure to be instructed to put as much pressure as possible on the inexperienced stand-in.

The Swans need the points to get safe from relegation while Stoke are still hoping for Europa League qualification. In their last four meetings at the Britannia Stadium, Stoke have won three. Despite losing Jack Butland for the season, Mark Hughes will be hoping Marko Arnautovic, a scorer in their past three home games, can be the difference again. Arthur Renard	15/16

Crystal Palace were fifth on New Year’s Eve but 13 games without a league win have transformed them into unlikely relegation candidates.

Certainly, even a home game against a fine Southampton side will feel like an opportunity and, for once, the hosts must perform after Tottenham Hotspur’s daunting trip to Anfield. The likes of Jamie Vardy, Danny Drinkwater and N’Golo Kanté will have returned to the King Power Stadium buoyed by their impact over the international break.

Everton were downed 3-0 at Goodison Park in October’s reverse fixture and Louis van Gaal said it was a complete display.

After all, Alex Neil’s side are one of the few teams below Crystal Palace, while Everton’s focus is purely on an FA Cup semi-final to come. Yet Alan Pardew’s side have lost their last six matches at Selhurst Park and Norwich are in their best form of the season and threatening to break free of the condemned.

This bounce may be required to dismantle a Tony Pulis side that could feature a four-man defence of centre-backs, as is the manager’s penchant. This was what Manchester United faced when they lost at The Hawthorns last month and, as Louis van Gaal’s side are at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, here is a chance to open up a four-point lead over United in the race for a Champions League berth.

If they are to make a late dash out of the relegation zone, they could do with getting their first away point – or three – of the year at St Mary’s. Aleksandar Mitrovic made a strong case for a starting spot, scoring twice at Norwich last week after coming off the bench, but Southampton’s central defenders are capable of stifling the Serb’s aerial ability and the hosts will fancy their chances of winning to reassert their push for European qualification.

However, Gylfi Sigurdsson’s three goals in his last four games have lifted Swansea from imminent danger and the Icelander’s semblance of his former brilliance could upset the odds.

However, the Spaniard will see Watford, who are on an even worse run of four defeats, as a golden opportunity to gain momentum ahead of their season-defining FA Cup semi-final. Quique Sánchez Flores will feel exactly the same as Watford have a semi-final of their own to contend against Crystal Palace. Graham Searles	15/16

Yet Arsenal are in good form, thrashing Everton and Watford in their previous two matches, and victory at Upton Park would keep their title hopes alive. Jacob Steinberg	15/16

Liverpool and Stoke City have met three times this season with the away team winning 1-0 on each occasion, although disappointingly for Mark Hughes that was not enough to take his side into the Capital One Cup final on their last visit to Anfield. Liverpool’s options are stretched in central midfield with Jordan Henderson injured and Emre Can commencing a two-match suspension. Andy Hunter	15/16

Jermain Defoe will hope to upstage Jamie Vardy on a day when Sunderland aim to prove they are not quite as bad as their position, third bottom in the table, suggests. Sam Allardyce’s problem is that Leicester will want to remind everyone – Tottenham particularly – why they would make worthy champions. Louise Taylor	15/16

Kyle Walker’s own goal gave United three points and a flying start to the season in August, but since then Tottenham have improved in all areas. United haven’t lost at White Hart Lane in any of their last 14 league encounters, and have two successive clean sheets behind them. Joel Tivemo	15/16

They could do with a win to help their top-four case. Alan Smith	15/16

Eight home league defeats are the principal reason for mounting criticism of the Everton manager, who has a Merseyside derby and FA Cup semi-final next week and may protect such leading players as Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley from minor knocks as a consequence.

Should Benitez’s players suffer another stumble survival will, realistically, be near impossible so the Spaniard could do with a strong performance from Jonjo Shelvey against his former employers. He must also cope without Daryl Janmaat, his Holland right back, who has undergone hand surgery after punching a dressing room wall in frustration during last Saturday’s defeat at frustration. Tynesiders can only pray Swansea’s Gylfi Sigurdsson’s recent stellar form deserts him. Louise Taylor	15/16

A win for Alex Neil’s team will give them at least a six-point cushion from the relegation zone – possibly more depending on events at St James’ Park – with four games to go. Newcastle, for once, will be hoping their local rivals win. Alan Smith	15/16

Albion have the worst shots-on-target average in the country, while Watford are on a stinking run of form (losing four of their last five) and might have an eye on next weekend’s FA Cup semi-final.

Their run-in looks favourable and they do have a cushion over fifth-placed Manchester United. Arsène Wenger merely wants victories over teams that Arsenal should be beating, and prayers to be answered. Crystal Palace have an FA Cup semi-final next Sunday. Has this been mentioned at all?

A trip to face Eddie Howe’s high-energy Bournemouth, who could remarkably finish in the top half in their debut top-flight season, is sure to be testing. The hosts will be without influential midfielder Harry Arter, though, who has an ankle injury that might rule him out of Euro 2016. Alan Smith	15/16

Leicester can afford to slip up in two of them and still win their first title but on current form it looks like they might secure the trophy with time to spare. Victory against West Ham, likely still hurting from their FA Cup exit to Manchester United in midweek, would see Claudio Ranieri’s team 10 points clear of Tottenham before the Londoners play Stoke on Monday. This fixture last season was the moment Leicester started their recovery, winning 2-1. Alan Smith	15/16

They should, however, have enough to beat Stoke, who remain saddled with selection problems in defence and have won only once in their last five outings. Jakob Haugaard has been unconvincing in goal so Stoke’s Irish veteran Shay Given could be brought in. Alan Smith	15/16

Things are unlikely to improve on Saturday with Southampton needing a win to keep their European hopes alive. Already relegated after nine defeats in a row, the only thing the Villa squad have left to play for is pride – but will they show any? Rich Flower	15/16

He heads back seeking a favour from his old club in his attempt to keep Newcastle in the Premier League, but Liverpool are not in the form to give one – regardless of what team Jürgen Klopp selects. With Villarreal in the Europa League semi-finals to come next week, Klopp may revert to the much-changed lineup that beat Bournemouth last Sunday. Andy Hunter	15/16

Now Stoke City must be beaten or Manchester United could overhaul Manuel Pellegrini’s side in the chase for a Champions League place. The visitors will need no reminding of how they dismantled City 2-0 in early December so this will be an intriguing watch. Jamie Jackson	15/16

Swansea, who have nothing to play for and have won away only three times all season, should be pushovers for the hosts but the pressure of leading the pack can have a funny effect – just ask Kevin Keegan.

And especially not when so much is at stake. While a win would enhance Sunderland’s survival chances considerably, Wenger’s need to make certain of Champions League qualification – while keeping those critics calling for his summer-time replacement at bay – should ensure a certain spice.

Arsène Wenger would simply sign up for some positivity.

With several key defenders injured or suspended the chance of them extending their poor defensive record at Goodison is likely. Youngsters Matthew Pennington and Kieran Dowell may be handed their league debuts. Max Gradel could return for Bournemouth whose only win in their past five games came at relegated Aston Villa. Eddie Howe might see the game as an audition to replace Martínez as he is currently third favourite with bookies, behind Manuel Pellegrini and David Moyes, to do so. Graham Searles	15/16

They do though possess Yohan Cabaye, and Rafa Benítez will be anxious to stop Tyneside’s one-time favourite midfielder reminding the club what they are missing. Cabaye needs to be kept quiet if Newcastle are to secure the victory they so desperately need. Louise Taylor	15/16

The good news for them is that Stoke City have lost their past three matches, conceding 12 goals in the process – and Sunderland need to turn draws into wins if they are going to stay up.

The real subplot surrounding this fixture is the future of Quique Sánchez Flores. The Spaniard guided Watford to an FA Cup semi-final and they sit safely in 12th place but just two wins in their past 11 league games has seemingly been a cause for concern for the club’s owners.

But a renaissance in fortunes for both Manchester clubs means West Ham must win this afternoon and hope Arsenal lose to stand a chance of reaching the Champions League. At least Bilic has a full squad to choose from for the trip to the Hawthorns, with striker Andy Carroll hoping to build on a run of six goals in his last six games. West Brom’s battling second half display against Spurs on Monday showed Tony Pulis’s side are not on the beach just yet, however. Ed Aarons	15/16

Rafael Benítez has provided United with a new-found confidence and, unbeaten in four, they should really have the measure of a Villa side whose embarrassing run of defeats now stands at 11. While they scored twice in their past two games, a shambolic defence has shipped four and three in the process. Alan Smith	15/16

So much so, the Bournemouth chairman, Jeff Mostyn, has forewarned supporters not to go on the pitch at the final whistle. Albion travel to the south coast level on points with the home side, who have lost five of their past six matches. Tony Pulis’s side are guilty of indifferent form themselves but salvaged a draw in their last away match at Tottenham and are more than capable of upsetting the mood once more here. Ben Fisher	15/16

A point against a Stoke side who have been beaten twice already this season and whose own form has unravelled of late will be enough to guarantee the hosts a third top-flight campaign, and allow them to refocus on Wembley on 21 May.

Another home game in midweek against Watford is an opportunity to pick up points but they cannot afford to have fallen further adrift by then and something is surely required from an upbeat Manchester United.

West Ham still have European places to play for, however, and while this penultimate game at Upton Park will be upstaged by Manchester United’s visit on Tuesday, Slaven Bilic has not given up on scraping into the top four.

Klopp cites the 3-0 defeat at Vicarage Road as one of the worst displays of his Liverpool tenure and will not want his players bullied again by Quique Sánchez Flores’s team. Andy Hunter	15/16

The disappointment of their collapsed Premier League title push is still fresh but there remains the significant matter of finishing above Arsenal for the first time since 1994-95. Tottenham have guaranteed themselves a place in the top three but the runners-up spot would ensure that they finally enjoy supremacy in their neighbourhood. Southampton’s motivation continues to be Europa League qualification. David Hytner	15/16

It would be sweet for them if they could pip Tottenham and finish above them as they always do but thoughts have already turned to next season.

More enticing will be the joyous reception granted the returning Claudio Ranieri with Roman Abramovich, the man who sacked him back in 2004, potentially watching on from his box in the West stand. Then there will be the accolades for Leicester City’schampions, and a second farewell to Guus Hiddink. Beyond that, the locals will merely be thankful this trying campaign is finally over.

The visit of relegated Norwich City would have been a mutinous, horrible affair had Martínez been kept on for one more game and it will be revealing if his former players suddenly show more commitment than they have done in recent weeks.

Rafael Benítez, though, wants to extend already relegated Newcastle’s five-game unbeaten run on an afternoon when home fans are planning to serenade the Spaniard in the hope of persuading him to stick around next season and lead them out of the second tier.

Alan Pardew returns to a club where he had perhaps his least impressive spell in management with next Saturday’s FA Cup final on his mind, even more so after Joe Ledley’s unfortunate leg-break against Stoke last week, so an under-strength Crystal Palace side is a distinct possibility.

There were times this season when being comfortably safe on the last day looked highly unlikely for Swansea, and while the decision to award Francesco Guidolin the job full-time this week was a surprise, it was a deserved one.

Burnley should give a debut to Johann Berg Gudmundsson but he is their only outfield signing so far – Aston Villa’s Ashley Westwood may follow – and there are concerns that last season’s Championship winners are thin on numbers and quality. Swansea must adjust to losing Ashley Williams and André Ayew in quick succession and the match comes too soon for record signing Borja Bastón. Both squads should look stronger at the month’s end but a negative start could be hard to claw back. Nick Ames	16/17

Yannick Bolasie looks to be on his way out of Palace but Alan Pardew expects him to be involved here, while Saido Berahino is in the visitors’ squad despite a chance he will move to Selhurst Park.

Ronald Koeman is in the process of rebuilding a squad that is lacking defensively, while Mauricio Pochettino will hope for further development from his talented young group. Everton have drawn their past three opening games 2-2, and a fourth would see them reach eight winless matches against Tottenham. Conor Matchett	16/17

Managerless Hull City, with only 13 fit professionals, look ripe for the taking. The home side will be particularly short in defence, with three centre-backs – Alex Bruce, Harry Maguire and the captain, Michael Dawson – injured, as well as the goalkeeper Alan McGregor. Suspension means Robert Huth is the only notable absentee for Leicester, who may give a debut to Ahmed Musa. Paul Macinnes	16/17

For now, with Vincent Kompany injured, he welcomes David Moyes’s side with a defence featuring new signing John Stones plunged straight in, so a win by any manner will do. Yet given the club’s riches and the 45-year-old’s pedigree there is no excuse for Guardiola not to have City as serious contenders. The missions starts here. Jamie Jackson	16/17

Boro fans will be keen to take a first look at Víctor Valdés, Álvaro Negredo, Marten de Roon et al, while Joe Allen is set to make his Stoke debut following a £13m move from Liverpool. Given that Karanka’s side conceded only eight Championship goals at home last season Mark Hughes must trust his strikers are wearing their shooting boots. Louise Taylor	16/17

Frenchman Claude Puel has joined Southampton while Italian maverick Walter Mazzarri takes charge of his first competitive match at Watford. The Saints are unbeaten in their past five against the visitors, and will be aiming to continue that run. Conor Matchett	16/17

It is easy to feel that the new season has come too soon for him and Arsenal, and Liverpool, who have injury concerns of their own, will seek to heighten the nagging anxiety at the Emirates. They do, however, have a poor away record against Arsenal, winning only once in 20 matches across 15 years. David Hytner	16/17

Mourinho will hope the summer arrivals, namely Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Henrikh Mkhitaryan can ensure a different outcome against Eddie Howe’s men this time around. “Zlatan is a great player, but you can pick any one of their players who will be a threat to us,” said Howe, who could give debuts to Jordon Ibe and Lewis Cook. “We’re looking forward to the game.” Ben Fisher	16/17

Antonio Conte may need some time to leave his mark on Chelsea but there is justified excitement at Stamford Bridge after last season’s horrors. West Ham arrive with two competitive games under their belt after progressing in the Europa League and it will be fascinating to see if Slaven Bilic can improve on last year’s fine performance.

Steven Defour should make his debut in midfield with David Jones having joined Sheffield Wednesday; Sean Dyche must wait to field Jon Flanagan, unavailable as he is on loan from Liverpool. An active Liverpool full-back, Alberto Moreno, was criticised after the 4-3 win at Arsenal but will retain his place after being backed by Jürgen Klopp. Nick Ames	16/17

Arsenal did the double over Leicester last season but were second best to them where it really mattered and they also failed in an attempt to sign Jamie Vardy in the summer. Robert Huth is back from suspension for Leicester while Laurent Koscielny, Mesut Özil and Olivier Giroud could all return for Arsenal. Stuart James	16/17

Quite probably, unless the home side start more quickly than they did at Middlesbrough. last week. Mark Hughes waits on the fitness of Xherdan Shaqiri, whose free-kick illuminated a much better second half, before deciding who faces his old club and will have to continue with another City old boy, the 40-year-old Shay Given, in goal while Jack Butland is laid low. Guardiola has no such issues; his own first-choice keeper, Willy Caballero, is fighting fit. Nick Ames	16/17

Gylfi Sigurdsson, who came off the bench at Burnley, could start for Swansea. Borja Baston, Swansea’s club-record signing, has been ruled out with a thigh injury, Neil Taylor is being given more time to recover from Euro 2016 and Leon Britton has been laid low with illness this week.

Connor Wickham will be keen to impress before Christian Benteke gets involved. It all points to a first win of the campaign for Tottenham, following on from their draw against Everton last weekend.

Antonio Conte earned Walter Mazzarri’s ire after mimicking his formation in a crunch Serie A fixture five years ago. He looks set to name an unchanged side after Chelsea’s late win over West Ham on Monday. The arrival of Younès Kaboul and Argentine midfielder Roberto Pereyra meanwhile will come too late for Watford this weekend, for whom Ben Watson is also suspended after his red card against Southampton.

Ronald Koeman will need to decide whether to use him from the start or as a substitute, though that could depend on the fitness of Romelu Lukaku. Ashley Williams’ availability is also touch and go for the visitors. Alan Smith	16/17

If David Moyes must trust Younès Kaboul’s defection to Watford does not leave Álvaro Negredo scenting blood, Jermain Defoe would relish defying Víctor Valdés. For the past five seasons Sunderland have failed to win a league game in August but, much as Moyes wants to put that right in his first home league match with his new club, Aitor Karanka could do with a derby win.

It has been a slow start to the season for the Hammers and Slaven Bilic will hope to have Dimitri Payet available from the start. Bournemouth, beaten by Manchester United last weekend, won this fixture last year thanks to Callum Wilson’s hat-trick. Jacob Steinberg	16/17

This, too, should prove tight. Dominic Fifield	16/17

These sides are currently pointless at the foot of the table, with Crystal Palace having been undone by set-pieces in each of their games and Christian Benteke’s lack of match fitness likely to see the record signing start on the bench. Wilfried Zaha may join him there after asking to leave this week. Bournemouth won in south-east London earlier this year as they surged to safety and Palace slipped the other way. This could condemn one of the sides to an international window dogged by self-doubt. Dominic Fifield	16/17

The last was a 4-3 thriller in December and Xherdan Shaqiri, who scored twice in that game, should be back while Peter Crouch is keen for an airing after his midweek hat-trick at Stevenage.

Claudio Ranieri will be hoping for better service to, and better finishing from, Jamie Vardy, who has yet to record a shot on target this season. If Swansea inflict another defeat on the champions, panic could take hold of Leicester’s pizzerias. Graham Searles	16/17

But the lack of ambition in the manager’s approach on the pitch in Sunderland’s first two matches should be of more concern. Moyes would be well advised to get a better display from his side at St Mary’s, where Southampton’s manager, Claude Puel, is looking for a first league win. Paul Doyle	16/17

Problems with consistency continue , which Klopp had alluded to well before their chastening defeat by Burnley last weekend. Tottenham Hotspur, too, are yet to find top gear this season after stuttering to their first win of the season against Crystal Palace but Klopp is wary of their talents. “We know they are strong, that’s the only thing we need to know,” he said. “We can be strong too and should show this on Saturday.” Ben Fisher	16/17

Not that Walter Mazzarri’s Watford are without their own concerns after losing their past two matches. Mazzarri has been busy in the transfer window but the new signings Roberto Pereyra, Younès Kaboul and Daryl Janmaat are unlikely to start. Paul MacInnes	16/17

A disrupted pre-season is no longer a factor and the Catalan’s side are flying. What will fascinate is when the Pep bounce falters and his side suffer a defeat. Slaven Bilic’s West Ham United won at the Etihad Stadium 2-1 last season, so might they be the team to offer City a first taste of adversity? Jamie Jackson	16/17

Albion have won the past four, scoring 11 goals without conceding one – including 5-0 and 3-0 wins. Yet Middlesbrough will fancy their chances of a win following a solid start to the season – despite the midweek cup loss at Fulham. It will be close. Alan Smith	16/17

Arsène Wenger said he has the “most mature squad for a long time” but they will not find it easy against Southampton, who will be hoping Fraser Forster is fit after missing England’s trip to Slovakia with an arm injury. Ryan Bertrand is also available. Alan Smith	16/17

Wilshere’s last league goal for Arsenal was in May 2015 against West Brom, whose manager, Tony Pulis, coached Howe as a teenager. Ben Fisher	16/17

A 3-0 defeat at Chelsea was rather more predictable but it is hard to know what to expect against a Hull side who were seconds away from an unbeaten start before losing to Manchester United. Jeff Hendrick should make his debut after a record move from Derby County, either in the middle or on the flanks Nick Ames	16/17

Anticipation is rife having spent August on the road and with the champions representing an awkward return home. Both Liverpool and Leicester have had a mixed start but will be looking to build on encouraging displays before the international break. Leicester’s £30m summer signing Islam Slimani could make his debut. Andy Hunter	16/17

The Manchester derby will offer clues about how United and City will fare this season and nothing more. Students of body language, the media, and fans will watch José Mourinho and Pep Guardiola, particularly around handshake time, but remember this: all that matters is what occurs on the pitch. The prospect is enticing. Jamie Jackson	16/17

Christian’s younger brother, and fellow striker, Jonathan is expected to be on the bench against a Middlesbrough side unbeaten in the league. Palace have only one point but might the pair’s respective early season positions be deceptive? An intriguing litmus test - not to mention clash of two contrasting counter-attacking styles - beckons.

Xherdan Shaqiri and Mame Biram Diouf are the latest casualties although there should be debuts for the defender Bruno Martins Indi and, up front, Wilfried Bony, both signed on loan before the deadline. Mark Hughes must decide whether to persist with a relatively conservative three-man central midfield against Tottenham, whose own start has been more solid than spectacular. Nick Ames	16/17

Another former Juve player, Robert Pereyra, should start for the visitors, having made his debut from the bench in the defeat at home to Arsenal. Alan Smith	16/17

The Brazilian’s return to Chelsea caught many by surprise but Antonio Conte thinks the 29-year-old could still become one of the world’s best defenders. Alan Smith	16/17

He will be assisted on the pitch by fellow Goodison Park old boys Steven Pienaar and Jack Rodwell, while a not yet fully fit Victor Anichebe looks on from the sidelines as Sunderland seek a morale-boosting first league win of the season. It should be particularly interesting to see how Lamine Koné, an £18m Everton transfer target this summer, performs in the home defence. Louise Taylor	16/17

Gareth Barry will join Ryan Giggs and Frank Lampard in the Premier League’s 600-club, 18 years after his debut for Aston Villa at Sheffield Wednesday, but whether Ross Barkley will join the immaculate veteran in midfield remains to be seen. Ronald Koeman has not shied from the big calls on the England international, on the pitch or in public. Romelu Lukaku is back among the goals after his hat-trick at Sunderland. Andy Hunter	16/17

However, the likelihood is slim considering the home side have beaten Arsenal once in 18 meetings. Arsène Wenger should have great faith three points will be banked here. The visitors have been prolific at the Kcom Stadium, winning five out of five. Graham Searles	16/17

Danny Simpson is fit again and Islam Slimani is in line to make his first Premier League appearance as the champions go in search of a second league win. Burnley, who also have four points from their opening four matches, could prove to be more awkward opponents than Brugge. Club-record signing Jeff Hendrick is set to make his first start for Sean Dyche’s side. Stuart James	16/17

The Catalan is already creating the myth that a side can be beaten before they walk past the white line for kick-off. Can, then, Bournemouth do what no other side has yet and, at least, fashion a draw? It appears a slim prospect even though City are without the sublime and prolific Sergio Agüero, who is suspended.

The manager’s weakened relationship with club hierarchy has dominated the buildup to this game. For West Ham so much has been made of the teething problems at their new stadium that their below-par start to the season has not been given as much attention as perhaps it should. Both could badly do with a win. Alan Smith	16/17

Alan Pardew and his players have visited the Senegalese in hospital this week and that might focus minds against Stoke, who prop up the division. Mark Hughes’ side have not prevailed in any of their last six games against Palace. They, too, are in need of a revival. Dominic Fifield	16/17

Charlie Austin put forward a strong case for a start against Swansea by scoring twice against the Czechs and the whole team looked comfortable in a 4-3-3 formation. The manager could build on that performance as he seeks his first Premier League win. Paul Doyle	16/17

The manager wants Sunderland to feel the backlash and, with David Moyes experiencing plenty of problems at the north-east club, Tottenham have a good opportunity to bounce back. Sunderland, winless and joint-bottom of the table, have a dismal record at White Hart Lane. David Hytner	16/17

Watford’s impressive four-goal comeback against West Ham last Saturday means United need to be wary. That said, José Mourinho is a chip-on-his-shoulder specialist and will no doubt be drilling into his side that victory must be the only outcome to keep up with their noisy neighbours.

To Chelsea it has been capital city supremacy. In the previous 10 editions of this fixture – excluding the Community Shield – the west London club have won seven times and there have been three draws. Wenger has called on his Arsenal players to buck the trend and nullifying Diego Costa is at the top of his agenda. The subplots are numerous and rich. Expect fireworks. David Hytner	16/17

Regardless of that, it’s another opportunity for Ronald Koeman’s side to showcase their intentions, while they can extend their unbeaten start in the league to six matches. Romelu Lukaku, who has scored five goals already this month, is expected to return from a toe injury after missing the midweek EFL Cup defeat by Norwich City. This fixture last season acted as a springboard for Bournemouth, who equalised in the eighth minute of stoppage time to record a 3-3 draw. The neutrals, and Bournemouth, would most probably settle for the same again this time around. Ben Fisher	16/17

Jürgen Klopp has a big call to make in goal, with Loris Karius pressing Simon Mignolet for inclusion, and faces a sustained test of Liverpool’s consistency with five of their next six games after Hull coming against sides who beat them last season. Hence the manager’s plea for patience from the Anfield crowd. Andy Hunter	16/17

The Portuguese is intent on ensuring Paul Pogba plays in his best position, so expect him on the left of a Manchester United 4-3-3. If, then, the captain is to be accommodated Anthony Martial’s injury may allow Rooney to play on the left of the front three. Jamie Jackson	16/17

Later the two former centre halves were fast tracked through their coaching badges on the same course in Madrid. Back then they could surely never have guessed that, almost a decade on, they would be reunited on Teesside with Karanka’s Middlesbrough hosting the Argentinian’s Tottenham. After straight defeats against Crystal Palace and Everton, Boro could do with a win and will hope to capitalise on Harry Kane’s absence. Louise Taylor	16/17

How Hughes can arrest a slump that has brought four limp defeats in a row, along with a League Cup exit to Hull, is anyone’s guess but Stoke’s treatment table is at least clearing and Xherdan Shaqiri may be able to play some part after recovering from the calf injury that has sidelined him since the opening day.

Such an event would represent a significant blow to David Moyes who is desperate to secure his first league win at Sunderland. Doing so will have to see his side attack more fluently as they have unleashed the fewest shots in the top tier this season and scored only three goals in their opening five fixtures.

The bad news for Swansea is that Sergio Agüero is back from suspension, which is the last thing Francesco Guidolin needs right now. Swansea’s manager is on the brink and another damaging result here could spell the end. Pep Guardiola, in contrast, goes in search of a 10th successive win in all competitions. Stuart James	16/17

At least Dimitri Payet’s late winner against Accrington Stanley in the EFL Cup restored some belief. Yet it is likely to be another fraught afternoon at the London Stadium, on and off the pitch, unless West Ham plug the holes in their defence. Meanwhile, Claude Puel’s side are looking for their fourth straight win in all competitions. Jacob Steinberg	16/17

They used a more cautious 4-2-3-1 shape at the King Power Stadium but may recall Sam Vokes to their normal 4-4-2 here or even hand a first start to loanee Patrick Bamford. Johann Berg Gudmundsson is another who could be recalled if Dyche fancies starting on the front foot.Nick Ames	16/17

Arsène Wenger said the American’s appointment was “good for the Premier League, because it is taking off in the States”, but the Arsenal manager’s concern is to record a home league win over Swansea for the first time since 2011.

It’s perhaps not one of the toughest trips at first glance, but Bournemouth are searching for a third straight home win in the Premier League. The on-loan Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere, who last played 90 minutes more than two years ago, is again likely to start behind the striker Callum Wilson, who is beginning to show glimpses of his best form.

I’m focused on improving my team, and I have good communication and a good relationship with the club. I take this with a smile.” He will retain his back three against Leicester, pointless away from home to date, and must decide whether John Terry returns to his lineup after injury.

A team struggling to adapt to a new home have yet to gain anything other than bloodied noses away from Stratford this term, with nine goals conceded in three defeats. Yet Alan Pardew and Crystal Palace are still braced for an awkward derby. West Ham have won 3-1 on their last two visits to Selhurst Park, “and they’ve got some fantastic players, players of international standard or even world-class ability,” offered Pardew. Palace must ensure the revival does not start south of the river. Dominic Fifield	16/17

Six points from seven games is a slightly disappointing return for Aitor Karanka who needs more from the currently under-achieving Gaston Ramírez and can only hope Álvaro Negredo rediscovers his scoring touch. In contrast, Watford’s Troy Deeney has scored three times in the last four games and Walter Mazzarri has challenged his centre forward to break into the England team. Louise Taylor	16/17

Both of their first-choice full-backs will miss the visit of Burnley, who will be aiming to become the first team in seven matches to score against Southampton.

Defeat for United would leave them six points behind their fierce north-west rivals and encourage the portrayal of Mourinho as a manager left behind by the pressing instincts of Jürgen Klopp and co, despite being only eight league matches into his Old Trafford reign. Klopp has injury concerns, however, over two thirds of his central midfield in Adam Lallana and Georginio Wijnaldum. Andy Hunter	16/17

Let alone the potential to claim top spot all for themselves. Meanwhile Middlesbrough are on a grim run of form having only won once from eight attempts. Aitor Karanka will have his work cut out to make his side believe they can stop Arsenal’s attacking force and spoil Wenger’s party. Graham Searles	16/17

Despite an encouraging start to the season, it will be tough going against a Ronald Koeman’s side who seem rejuvenated following his appointment in the summer. The visitors are just two points off a Champions League place and boast one of the division’s form players in Romelu Lukaku. They have also won the past three league contests between the teams.

A broken kneecap sustained by Moses Odubajo in training means the Hull City manager may switch to a back three to compensate for a lack of available full-backs as he seeks to shore up the top flight’s leakiest defence.

Palace currently lie ninth, having been boosted in the transfer window by the arrival of Christian Benteke.

The last three meetings between the teams have been drawn but, having defended Manchester United’s long balls on Monday, Klopp believes Liverpool are better equipped to deal with the Tony Pulis approach that caused him and his players such consternation last season. Adam Lallana is fit to start and improve the urgency and accuracy that was missing from Liverpool’s display against United. Andy Hunter	16/17

There were plenty of encouraging signs for the American in his first game in charge, as his side narrowly lost to Arsenal.

Given that West Ham have been uncomfortable in their new home, this is a good opportunity for David Moyes’s strugglers.

This is his first return to Stamford Bridge as manager of a rival Premier League club and many of those players who under-performed so badly last term will line up against his Manchester United side. “He deserves a good reception,” said Antonio Conte. “He is part of the story of this club.” Some of those on the pitch may have their own points to prove to the Portuguese.

This might not be reasonable but in English football’s boom-and-bust culture it is just the way it is.

Palace have a strong record against them at Selhurst Park despite defeat last season and have won four of the last seven league matches there.

Arsenal are probably the last team David Moyes would want to be facing as he strives to secure an elusive first league victory since succeeding Sam Allardyce in July but a crowd well in excess of 45,000 is expected to turn up to see him try.

Claudio Ranieri’s side waited and they waited, before wrapping up the title in relatively comfortable style. Their 1-0 win in this fixture last January had been a crucial result – on a night when Mauricio Pochettino was as animated as he has been in the White Hart Lane dug-out.

Hull are without a league win since August, and were dealt a huge blow with the loss of captain and top scorer Robert Snodgrass to an ankle injury in their 2-0 home defeat to Stoke. Mike Phelan has also lost striker Adama Diomandé, who was banned for violent conduct after Hull’s EFL Cup victory, Phelan’s first since becoming manager permanently, over Bristol City.

Fortunately for City they have won nine of their past meetings against West Brom. But can a team lacking a cutting edge break down a notoriously rigid defensive unit? Alan Smith	16/17

The early season confidence surrounding Everton has dispersed as a result and Slaven Bilic, by contrast, returns to Goodison Park in the belief West Ham’s season is improving following three consecutive victories. It might also be a relief to get away from the Olympic Stadium. Andy Hunter	16/17

You could not get great odds on Mark Hughes surviving the season after overseeing a limp 4-1 defeat at Crystal Palace in mid-September but Stoke, inspired by Joe Allen and Xherdan Shaqiri, have rallied since. A point at Old Trafford preceded comfortable wins against Sunderland and Hull; Stoke might well be expected to beat such opposition and the visit of Swansea seems similarly appetising. Victory for the visitors would be Bob Bradley’s first as manager, but what price Wilfried Bony will coming to the party and opening his account for Stoke against his old club? Nick Ames	16/17

Sunderland were in the vicinity only last week, after flying back to the north-east from Bournemouth airport after a poor performance against Southampton in the EFL Cup. A much-needed win would provide Moyes at least some respite. Bournemouth, meanwhile, will hope home comforts can see them return to winning ways, after an indifferent performance in defeat by Middlesbrough last time out. Ben Fisher	16/17

Sean Dyche’s defence rode out a storm at Old Trafford last week and have shown they will be intensely competitive. Their injury concerns are easing too and Dyche must decide whether to restore the fit-again Steven Defour to the midfield after a win and a draw in his absence. Nick Ames	16/17

The fees being quoted for the Belgian over the summer had been mind-boggling. As it is, he stayed at Goodison Park and Diego Costa is thriving again at Stamford Bridge. “Diego is not only scoring the goals but working a lot for the team,” said Conte of the division’s leading scorer to date this term. “I’m seeing a complete player in Diego.” Theirs will be an intriguing tête-à-tête.

Pep Guardiola’s side now appear over the hump of six games with no wins – a sequence that did not affect their status as leaders. Aitor Karanka’s side are a respectable 15th, three points above the drop zone. But it would represent a shock and setback for City should they lose on Saturday. Jamie Jackson	16/17

But Slaven Bilic’s side also have problems on the pitch. They are 17th and face a Stoke side unbeaten in their past five matches. Stoke have concerns in attack, though, with Marko Arnautovic suspended and Xherdan Shaqiri doubtful because of a hamstring problem. Jacob Steinberg	16/17

Tottenham might be unbeaten in the Premier League but they have hit something of a wall in creative terms while Arsenal have goals in them and their tails up. Arsène Wenger has injury doubts over a clutch of players but he has selection headaches in a good way. The return of Harry Kane is a prominent sub-plot. David Hytner	16/17

Mike Phelan’s side have lost six successive league games and a good run in the EFL Cup is unlikely to lift spirits. However Phelan could be thrown a lifeline if Robert Snodgrass returns from injury, the Scot was instrumental in Hull’s early season triumphs. Graham Searles	16/17

They will have to do without Kasper Schmeichel against West Brom after he fractured his hand against Copenhagen. Ron-Robert Zieler, Schmeichel’s deputy, can expect some sort of aerial assault against an Albion side without a win in five matches and reeling from last Saturday’s hammering at home to Manchester City.

The joint league leaders have not lost at Anfield since January and have won 12 and drawn three of their last 18 home matches; they are nine points better off than at the same stage last season.

Swansea, on the face of it, should be benign opponents. They are second from bottom, without a victory since the opening day and have collected only two points from a possible 27, prompting Bob Bradley to describe keeping Swansea up as a “huge” job.

The hosts are further hampered by the loss of Steve Mandanda to a knee injury but, while they are intent on resurgence, this will also be a sombre occasion. Tributes are to be paid to those who lost their lives in the Croydon tram derailment, with Palace and their players having made donations to the fund set up for the families involved.

The Wales international faces his former club for the first time since his £12m move to Everton, who are also under pressure to react following a 5-0 mauling at Chelsea before the international break that manager Ronald Koeman described as “unacceptable in every aspect of football”.

An array of players face late fitness tests before the game. That is far from ideal for the Frenchman, whose team already betrayed signs of wear and tear in their last game before the international break, a defeat at Hull. Yet Liverpool, who also have fitness worries, will know they will need to be close to their best to get the win that will ensure they remain top of the table. Paul Doyle	16/17

Their revival coincided with the return of key players to fitness but there are several doubts for Bournemouth’s visit, although Xherdan Shaqiri and Marko Arnautovic return and it would take a brave punter to back an away win. Bournemouth have taken two points on the road and another slim return would drag them nearer to the relegation places.

Hull’s manager may have forgiven his Sunderland counterpart but he almost certainly has not forgotten as their teams prepare for a game which surely offers a near perfect definition of the term “relegation six pointer”. With Will Keane out for the season and Abel Hernández injured, Hull lack attacking firepower and will be more dependent on Robert Snodgrass than ever. Louise Taylor	16/17

Unfortunately for Claudio Ranieri’s side they face Watford, a team not only six places above them in the table but one looking to avenge their own humbling 6-1 defeat at the hands of Liverpool. Watford’s Walter Mazzarri insists his side should be “angry” but he will also be relieved that Heurelho Gomes has recovered quickly from a knee injury. Leicester, meanwhile, are still without Kasper Schmeichel, while Danny Drinkwater is 50/50 with a rib injury. Paul MacInnes	16/17

If Middlesbrough’s recent draws at Arsenal and Manchester City should make title chasing Chelsea suitably wary, they are likely to have to contend with the fit again Diego Costa and Eden Hazard. Ben Gibson’s duel with Costa promises to be an intriguing sub-plot as the visitors seek to emphasise their rebirth under Antonio Conte whose tactical joust with Karanka could be fascinating.

However, Salomon Rondón’s return from injury should keep spirits high. Sean Dyche must share his counterpart’s sentiments but will be confident momentum lies with Burnley.

Their 4-0 defeat continued some poor away form but at Turf Moor things are rather different and, having beaten Liverpool and Everton there as well as losing unfairly to Arsenal, they should make a fight of this one. Pep Guardiola may be considering Wednesday’s night Champions League away trip was not to have not been the best preparation for a Saturday lunchtime game against opponents who will not stop running.

They may have Andrew Robertson and Adama Diomandé back to face a West Brom side who were themselves the subject of grumbling from fans earlier in the season, but are in fine fettle after impressive wins over Leicester City and Burnley.

Danny Drinkwater will be suspended for the visit of Middlesbrough, giving Andy King an opportunity to make a rare start. One point and one place behind Leicester, Aitor Karanka’s side also need the points and could do with a goal from Álvaro Negredo, who has not scored since the opening day of the season.

That equals Liverpool’s most prolific output since scoring 19 in five in 1980-81. Andy Hunter	16/17

Swansea are rock bottom of the table and without a victory since the opening day of the season. Crystal Palace, on the other hand, have lost their last five and travel to the Liberty Stadium with Alan Pardew, their manager, under growing pressure. Bob Bradley seems likely to stick with the same side that drew at Everton, so Gylfi Sigurdsson will play as a false No9. Joe Ledley could come back into contention for Palace. Stuart James	16/17

Victory is imperative against Bournemouth to produce a much-needed shot in the arm heading into the congested Christmas period. Eddie Howe will be the much more relaxed of the two managers, his side have exceeded expectation this season and, in only their third league meeting with Arsenal, would love to add to Wenger’s traditional autumnal woes.

Given the close nature of the title race, a repeat of this could move José Mourinho’s side into the upper echelons. For West Ham even a single victory would be welcome: their last in the Premier League was over a month ago, when Sunderland were beaten 1-0 on 22 October. Jamie Jackson	16/17

His successor at Southampton, Claude Puel, will hope that his team overcome their profligate streak. They need to start scoring more, as bad finishing jeopardised their Europa League campaign in mid-week and has cost them a lot of points in the Premier League this season. Paul Doyle	16/17

If Mark Hughes wants a strong reaction he can take inspiration from Watford who responded to a humiliating defeat at Liverpool by tearing into Leicester last week, going 2-0 up after 12 minutes. Walter Mazzarri reshaped his side for that match and Odion Ighalo looks likely to stay on the bench, such was the quality of Roberto Pereyra’s showing with Troy Deeney. Joe Allen is suspended for Stoke, while his midfield partner Glenn Whelan is doubtful with a calf problem. Paul MacInnes	16/17

Crystal Palace go into this game on the back of six successive defeats, a run that has taken them to the brink of the relegation zone, with concerned owners considering the merits of Sam Allardyce, Chris Coleman, Roberto Mancini and Roy Hodgson as alternatives. Only victory will do but Southampton arrive buoyed by a fine display at Arsenal that has earned them a first League Cup semi-final in 30 years. Two years ago, their win at Selhurst Park cost Neil Warnock his job at Palace. History may be repeating itself. Dominic Fifield	16/17

While that defeat proved an omen of the demise of Mourinho and his champions, Chelsea arrive as leaders and a point better off than City, which means a draw would be a fine result for them. Expect both teams, though, to go for what would be a statement victory. Jamie Jackson	16/17

Will he stick with the back three he selected against Watford, who were so successful last week? Will Joe Allen, in such fine form before suspension, come back into a side who dominated at Vicarage Road with a big contribution from the midfielder’s replacement, Giannelli Imbula? Sean Dyche will hope Hughes is blinded by his options: Burnley could do with something here after two consecutive defeats. Nick Ames	16/17

He comes to London with his team still in the relegation places but with renewed belief and ready to confront opponents who have lost some fluency over the past two months. For Tottenham, this feels like a must-win. David Hytner	16/17

He may have to cope without Salomón Rondón, sent home with tonsilitis, as Watford, a place higher and enjoying their best start since the mid-80s, seek more reward and with Troy Deeney after his 100th club goal.

News that Santi Cazorla requires surgery on an ankle injury is a blow but Arsène Wenger’s side have not lost in the league since the opening day, while West Ham are a point above the bottom three.

Jürgen Klopp’s side are in dominant form, manifested in a 15-match unbeaten run in all competitions that the German will expect to be extended. However, without Philippe Coutinho to terrorise his defenders, Eddie Howe can find some solace. The focus for Bournemouth will be finding attacking flair of their own after scoring just three goals in five matches, since putting six past Hull in October. Graham Searles	16/17

Ronald Koeman, in contrast, appears to be losing belief in the talent at his disposal by the week but insists “a lot of things can change on Sunday”. Andy Hunter	16/17

While Harry Maguire – a centre half coveted by Aitor Karanka – may have a chance to audition for a January move by marking Álvaro Negredo, the absence of Boro’s injured left-back George Friend could permit Robert Snodgrass to undermine the potentially vulnerable Fábio da Silva. Do not bet against Adama Traoré’s extraordinary pace and dribbling ability for Boro proving key though. Louise Taylor	16/17

They have taken apart West Ham and Basel and are determined to maintain the pressure on the leaders, Chelsea. Stoke, though, are in confident mood, having tightened up at the back and taken an impressive 18 points from 27. Could they get something at Arsenal for the first time since 1981? David Hytner	16/17

They have lost three games in a row for the first time this season and need to arrest the slump quickly; on the plus side they continue to impress at Turf Moor, running Manchester City mightily close two weeks ago, and Bournemouth will not inspire too much fear despite their remarkable comeback against Liverpool. Eddie Howe’s visitors could use that being the springboard for some consistency now, and victory should strengthen their position in the top half. Nick Ames	16/17

No such respite for the hosts who have seen everything go downhill since their transfer embargo was lifted and they began signing players. Palace could do with another win but Hull are desperate with a tough run of fixtures coming up. Neither side are strong in defence but the visitors’ attack is significantly more threatening which could make for another tough afternoon for Mike Phelan. Jack Harry	16/17

It would be tempting to predict a role reversal narrative but considering Swansea’s thrashing at the hands of Tottenham last time out this seems unlikely. A win for Bob Bradley’s side will see them overtake the visitors but David Moyes must be targeting a fourth win in five. Jack Harry	16/17

Ronald Koeman will hardly be confident he can foil Walter Mazzarri’s side. The visitors have won once in nine attempts since a run of four successive victories ended in September. To spark an upturn in fortunes Romelu Lukaku will have to start scoring more frequently, he has just one goal in his last six matches. Everton’s next top-scorer is Gareth Barry. Graham Searles	16/17

Last season West Ham recorded a league double over Liverpool for the first time since 1963-64, knocking Jürgen Klopp’s side out of the FA Cup too for good measure, but they return to Anfield without a win in six matches, one point above the relegation zone and with their manager under pressure following a humiliating 5-1 home defeat by Arsenal last weekend. Bilic needs a reaction, but so does Klopp following Liverpool’s collapse at Bournemouth. There is plenty at stake. Andy Hunter	16/17

Tottenham Hotspur are six points ahead of José Mourinho’s side in fifth place and given Mauricio Pochettino was of interest to United before hiring the Portuguese each man may have a little extra motivation to deliver three points.

A heavy defeat at Crystal Palace was followed by elimination from the Europa League and a serious injury to Charlie Austin, the only player who has scored regularly for the club this season. Middlesbrough have lost only one match away in the league this season and will feel confident of adding to Claude Puel’s woes. Paul Doyle	16/17

The hosts have the joint worst home record in the division and are undermined by injuries, with Alan Pardew still a manager very much under pressure. It is doubtful a mooted fan protest will amount to much but there is local disquiet after a wretched league year, and a squad reduced to 13 fit senior outfield players will do well to contain the visitors.

This latest relegation six pointer represents the start of a potentially season-defining run of, on paper at least, winnable games for Swansea whose next four fixtures pit Bob Bradley’s side against West Ham, Bournemouth, Crystal Palace and Hull.

They are, at least, well stocked in attack and Mame Biram Diouf or Wilfried Bony will come in. Leicester would just like consistency: they lost 1-0 at Bournemouth on Tuesday – some anticlimax after their heroics against Manchester City. Nick Ames	16/17

With Sunderland’s January transfer coffers bare, this season’s relegation fight will be all about making do and mending for Moyes whose attempt to lift his team out of the mire would be enhanced if they could start scoring from set pieces. The big problem is that Wahbi Khazri and Sebastian Larsson, his two dead-ball specialists, are merely substitutes these days. Louise Taylor	16/17

It may sound unbelievable but Tony Pulis, frequently maligned for negative tactics, has his side playing with attacking verve and as a result they have scored one more goal than Manchester United in the league leaving them one place behind the visitors in seventh. However José Mourinho is unlikely to be fearful and will have the utmost faith that his improving side can take the spoils. Graham Searles	16/17

After beating Burnley on Wednesday, they will be confident of finally recording consecutive wins in the league at the London Stadium. Andy Carroll is set to start again for Slaven Bilic’s side, who could condemn Hull to spending Christmas at the bottom of the table. Jacob Steinberg	16/17

They are level on points but Claude Puel’s side sit narrowly ahead of Bournemouth on goal difference. This is only their 24th meeting and for now it remains low-key. “The more games we play against Southampton the more the rivalry will grow,” Howe said on Friday. “It’s something we’re looking forward to.” Ben Fisher	16/17

A point and a position separates Manchester City from Arsenal, in fourth and third respectively. And as City have not beaten the visitors since a 6-3 walloping three years ago, a victory for them would be particularly satisfying. One outcome seems certain – this will not be a goalless draw.

But Burnley had their moments in defeat at West Ham United on Wednesday and they revel in confounding the doubters. As Sean Dyche almost said on Friday, aren’t they supposed to be down already?

Everton, who will be without the suspended captain, Phil Jagielka, are unbeaten at home in the Premier League this season but have not won any of the last 12 derbies. For all the scrutiny on their defence, Liverpool have kept four clean sheets in their last six matches and Jürgen Klopp will hope Joël Matip recovers from an ankle injury for their first experience of Goodison Park.

Back-to-back wins over Middlesbrough and Sunderland cannot be discounted given their impressive home form, and might also help Sean Dyche attract the right January reinforcements. Their first festive test sees a rematch with last season’s Championship rivals Boro, with whom they shared a draw at Turf Moor in April. Aitor Karanka’s side, who cut loose all of a sudden in overwhelming Swansea, would consider a repeat of that a reasonable enough return this time too. Nick Ames	16/17

The Italian will be aware that Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth won in south-west London last season, albeit while José Mourinho’s tenure was unravelling, and they will be awkward opponents. This will provide a test of sorts of the depth of Chelsea’s squad ahead of the transfer window. Dominic Fifield	16/17

And who can blame them? Without being disrespectful, Mike Phelan’s side should offer the chance for Pep Guardiola to test tactics and prepare for Sergio Agüero’s return at Anfield. Bottom-club Hull will be hoping for a Christmas miracle in order to salvage a result. Graham Searles	16/17

Claudio Ranieri needs his side to pick up from where they left off to earn three points that would ensure not falling into the relegation zone before the new year. However the ill discipline of Jamie Vardy, Robert Huth and Christian Fuchs could cost them against an Everton side in the mood to avenge their excruciating derby defeat. Graham Searles	16/17

If other results go their way Bilic’s side could climb into the top half of the Premier League table. However, Bob Bradley will have watched the footage from West Ham’s past two wins and will see a side that is beatable, despite Swansea’s lowly standing – fans voted for the post to be man of the match at the London Stadium against Hull after it saved the home side three times.

Liverpool have never lost a top-flight league game at home to Stoke – a sequence stretching back 53 games – although Mark Hughes’s team were the last to win at Anfield in the League Cup back in January.

The absence of Jordan Pickford, Sunderland’s breakout star of 2016, may help them as Vito Mannone could be rusty after not featuring since 21 August.

Stoke drew at Stamford Bridge and twice triumphed at home against the Londoners last term. They represent distinctly awkward opposition. Dominic Fifield	16/17

To that end, City are helped by the returns from suspension of Robert Huth and Christian Fuchs. Mark Tallentire	16/17

Liverpool and Manchester City do battle for second place. Both sides are so evenly matched, explosive in attack and liable to blunders at the back, that a coin toss might be the most effective way of choosing the victor. Sergio Agüero may disagree, the Argentinian will be eager to test the frequently error-prone Simon Mignolet with a thunderbolt or two. Graham Searles	16/17

Two seasons have passed since United last did the same number. In the sole golden run under Louis van Gaal, the February-April period of the 2014-15 season, United won six consecutive league games and offered an outside chance of the title before defeat at Chelsea, the eventual champions. The manager of the west Londoners then? Mourinho. Jamie Jackson	16/17

Southampton are likely to have most of the ball against West Brom but Claude Puel’s side are still struggling to find sharpness so the well organised visitors will fancy their chances of pinching a win.

However, the hope that things on the pitch will change for Swansea is hampered by the fact Alan Curtis, the caretaker manager, does not have much to choose from beyond the players who lost so pitifully against West Ham on Boxing Day. Bournemouth will hope to profit. Conrad Leach	16/17

Ludicrously, Southampton are playing for the third time in six days and Claude Puel has admitted it will be a struggle to juggle his resources at Goodison Park. Tom Davies, sharp as a substitute at Hull City on Friday, may get a chance to start in Everton’s midfield, with Koeman keen to protect Gareth Barry from two games in quick succession.

The most troubling element of Saturday’s 1-0 defeat at Liverpool was that it was no surprise. Pep Guardiola’s side have been misfiring for a while despite the three wins on the bounce beforehand. Can Burnley turn them over at the Etihad? Sean Dyche’s side are 11th and have won their past two games, so this is another test for City. Jamie Jackson	16/17

The Italian should be especially keen because this is the last game for which Islam Slimani and Riyad Mahrez will be available before leaving for the Africa Cup of Nations. Middlesbrough’s scoring average of fewer than one goal a game will not worry their opponents, who need to improve in 2017. Graham Searles	16/17

Sunderland are in poor form and lost 4-1 at Burnley last time out. There should, then, be only one winner. But with the visitors having less than 44 hours to prepare for this game and possibly lacking Jordan Henderson through injury, the hosts may sense they can cause an upset. Sachin Nakrani	16/17

Tony Pulis’s side are riding high in eighth place and will look to consolidate that today, whereas Hull, in 19th, know they need to start winning soon if an instant return to the Championship is to be avoided.

How José Mourinho would love to continue 2017 in a similar vein with a sixth. However, he will be without Eric Bailly, who has joined up with his Ivory Coast team-mates before the Africa Cup of Nations while Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney are both doubts. West Ham, who lost at Leicester City on Saturday, may be without the captain Mark Noble. Ben Fisher	16/17

Benik Afobe, in particular, will have been lifted by getting on the scoresheet at the Liberty Stadium before facing his former club. The on-loan Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere, though, is ineligible to play against his parent club, with Arsène Wenger hopeful of a second win in three days. Ben Fisher	16/17

Defeat at Selhurst Park on Monday will not cost Sam Allardyce his job but it would put Palace in danger of slipping into the mire. Rich Flower	16/17

They had been positive for the first 45 minutes and the manager felt that it showed they were over their Champions League exit. But they still lost, as everybody has done to Chelsea in the league over the past three months. Tottenham are in form and this could be wild. Can they stop the Chelsea juggernaut? David Hytner	16/17

Abel Hernández, last season’s top scorer, who has missed half of Hull’s league matches, is fit and the new arrival Oumar Niasse could also feature. Bournemouth will also have fresh legs, having rested their entire team for the embarrassing FA Cup defeat against Millwall.

Thirteen months on and the normal order has been restored as Leicester languish in the bottom half and Chelsea lead the way, yet Claudio Ranieri’s side have a chance to upset the apple cart. Jamie Vardy returns for Leicester after recovering from illness, with Nathan Aké set to replace the suspended John Terry in Chelsea’s squad. Stuart James	16/17

Already underwhelmed by what is turning into a slog of a league campaign, Stoke fans were seriously unhappy about that reverse and Hughes knows a correction is needed. Sunderland remain desperate to secure a win that seems near essential to sustaining David Moyes’s hopes of escaping relegation. Louise Taylor	16/17

While the good news for Arsenal is that Mesut Özil is back after illness, Hector Bellerín and Francis Coquelin are among a long list of absentees. Swansea have their own problems, with Neil Taylor and new signing Luciano Narsingh ruled out. Arsenal’s Olivier Giroud, who has scored in his past four matches, could be the man to watch.

They have six straight wins in all competitions and are playing the sort of football that took them close to the title last season.

They will, however, hope to arrest a slide that has secured only one point from five matches. The loan signing Tom Cleverley could start, while Heurelho Gomes and José Holebas return from illness.

West Ham United have been rocked by Dimitri Payet’s request to leave and the France midfielder will be a notable absentee at the London Stadium.

Guardiola’s side were on top form at West Ham United and Ronald Koeman said City could repeat that 5-0 FA Cup win should Everton reproduce the feeble defensive display that led to them being knocked out of the competition by Leicester City last weekend.

Yet during that run they also scored three in routing Swansea and drawing at home to Arsenal. The visitors have injuries and absences and are skirting with trouble, winless in the league since 10 December and with only two goals in six games. Stuart Goodwin	16/17

The current side have not even managed a goal when welcoming these opponents in this latest four-year stint in the top flight, which makes this fixture a daunting prospect. Sam Allardyce would have liked more additions than just Jeffrey Schlupp to throw in for a home debut. These are troubling times. Dominic Fifield	16/17

Jürgen Klopp’s side have scored 26 goals in nine home league games and host a Swansea side that have kept only one clean sheet in 13 games. New recruits Martin Olsson and Tom Carroll could debut for Paul Clement’s visitors but a third, Dutch winger Luciano Narsingh, is doubtful with a calf injury. Andy Hunter	16/17

They would not be out of it, of course, but it would add to the questions hovering over Guardiola’s side. Only an impressive defeat of Spurs might answer them but given the visitors’ form this seems unlikely. Jamie Jackson	16/17

We need to try to stop him, to stop the balls to him.” Expert at securing goalless draws, Boro are only four points above the relegation zone and have scored just 17 times in 21 league games. Patrick Bamford, newly signed from Chelsea for £6m, hopes to improve such statistics but will begin on the bench. Louise Taylor	16/17

Manchester United will offer a stern test for Mark Hughes’s side and although the visitors’ run of nine straight wins in all competitions was ended by last week’s draw with Liverpool, they are still favourites to avenge the 2-0 defeat they suffered here in December 2015.

Yet despite last Saturday’s dismantling by Spurs the hosts are worthy of a top eight place and buoyed by a versatile signing in Jake Livermore.

The Frenchman will be delighted by the prospect of having many more options at his disposal. Sean Dyche’s side have taken one point away from home this season in nine matches and have conceded 20 goals. Alexis Sánchez has all the motivation he needs. Graham Searles	16/17

Chelsea play last of the title contenders and will be hoping to extend their lead at the top this weekend. “But our challenge is to keep the right concentration,” said the Italian. “If you think this game is easy, you make a great mistake and you can pay for this mistake at the end of the season.” He will be wary of ‘new coach bounce’.

Claudio Ranieri’s side need to do better this time in order to hoist themselves further clear of the relegation zone and they may be helped by Southampton preparing for their EFL Cup semi-final second leg against Liverpool on Wednesday.

That damaging defeat to Watford has left Arsène Wenger’s side forlorn. They are hampered too by Chelsea’s eagerness to avenge that humiliation endured at the Emirates in September.

The same cannot be said about Bournemouth who looked poor against Crystal Palace in midweek and are drifting towards the relegation zone. To make matters worse they are without Callum Wilson, who ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in training. Dan Brown	16/17

A repeat performance, particularly in defence, will be in order when Liverpool visit with the aim of putting their January slump behind them. Sadio Mané, Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana all scored in the 5-1 defeat of Hull at Anfield in September and Jürgen Klopp finally has a full range of attacking options at his disposal again.

Virgil van Dijk’s injury leaves Claude Puel with few central defensive options. But if Saints manage to plug the gap at the back and take their chances up front they could still have the last laugh.

Aitor Karanka’s Middlesbrough do not give much away – particularly on their Premier League travels, where only Chelsea and Tottenham have conceded fewer goals. But Mauricio Pochettino’s team have come to look imposing at home and they back themselves to cut loose against anyone. David Hytner	16/17

Any away win for Burnley would be unlikely as they are still stuck on just the one point gained away from Turf Moor all season. They will be missing Steven Defour with a hamstring injury but have both their deadline-day signings in Robbie Brady and Ashley Westwood ready for action. Watford will assess Miguel Britos and will be tempted to give the forward M’Baye Niang his second start in five days. Paul MacInnes	16/17

I wish him all the best.” These were the words spoken by Tony Pulis on Saido Berahino – the pantomime villain of The Hawthorns after his overdue departure. But, should Berahino enter from stage left for his full Stoke debut, it promises to be a better contest than many may think. Just four points split the sides, who are eighth and ninth respectively.

That was during his time in charge of Chelsea, when Leicester were on their way to winning the title. It seems like a distant memory now, and it is Ranieri, not Mourinho, who goes into this game under pressure. Depending on results elsewhere, Leicester could be in the bottom three by the time they kick off. United need a win to break a run of three draws. Stuart James	16/17

Can the Manchester City manager somehow plot his way to a third win over Swansea City this season? The first question comes after the striker and the No1 keeper were left out for the 4-0 win at West Ham United.

Arsène Wenger can hear the squeals of protest and the problem of whether he ought to stay on at Arsenal dominates the agenda. Wenger only ever seems to be one defeat from crisis.

His team have won once in 10, whereas Tottenham are unbeaten in 10 and will go seven points clear of Liverpool with a rare league win at Anfield.

Although difficult to beat, Boro have won fewer Premier League games – four – than anyone, with their last victory coming in December. Karanka could probably do without meeting a recently somewhat more direct, higher tempo, Everton, who are very much the division’s form team.

It seems illogical but as they proved by crushing Crystal Palace away last Saturday, Sunderland have a penchant for the unexpected. Indeed lack of consistency is their primary problem so the visit of a talented yet vulnerable Southampton represents a telling challenge. Can Moyes’s players win again or will they disappoint?

Albion are undefeated in three while the Hammers again have fitness concerns over Andy Carroll, who has not trained all week and needs a goal to become the fifth man to score 30 Premier League goals for them.

Burnley are without three first-team midfielders, with Ashley Westwood and Robbie Brady in line to make their first starts. Sean Dyche’s side cannot absorb too many key absences but should have enough willpower to make Chelsea work hard for anything they take away. Nick Ames	16/17

It is a huge game for two clubs who are separated only by goal difference. Swansea have won three of their past five league matches. Leicester have lost their last four and have yet to score a league goal this year. Stuart James	16/17

Bournemouth are another team with a porous defence and one yet to record victory this calendar year.

Claude Makelele will be afforded a huge ovation on his return as one of Paul Clement’s assistants. Carlo Ancelotti’s former No2 has won four of six league games and his side can sense a route to safety. “Now it’s about asking: ‘How much do we want to avoid suffering at the end of the season?’” said Clement. They are eager to secure the points required sooner rather than later, and even a trip to Chelsea will not daunt them. Dominic Fifield	16/17

Middlesbrough, supremely stingy but without an away win since August, arrive at Selhurst Park hoping to emulate Sunderland’s recent saunter in south London by tapping into Palace’s insecurities at home. Palace, a team on edge even after a fortnight’s break, cannot afford another slip up. “It’s not Middlesbrough we’re playing against,” Sam Allardyce said. “We’re playing against ourselves.” This has to be their moment, or the Championship surely beckons.

He can ill-afford another demoralising match against his former club. Sunderland are anchored to the bottom of the table and will need more than a trip to New York to recover from the 4-0 home defeat by Southampton. Leighton Baines is in line to make his 300th Premier League appearance for Everton. Andy Hunter	16/17

Their away form continues to be awful though, with just one point earned on their travels. Such travails will not be helped by an injury to Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Jeff Hendrick’s ban. Marco Silva’s resurgent side will be missing Sam Clucas through suspension but are otherwise likely to boast a side unchanged from the one that lost narrowly to Arsenal. Paul MacInnes	16/17

West Ham’s Andy Carroll looks set to miss out while he continues to recover from a groin injury but Aaron Cresswell returns. Paul MacInnes	16/17

The problem is abundantly clear, Eddie Howe’s side are too vulnerable in defence – conceding 21 goals in their past seven matches in all competitions. Tony Pulis will look to capitalise and if successful West Brom will be just nine points behind their record Premier League total. Graham Searles	16/17

The familiar surroundings of White Hart Lane should be a boost and it is hard to see Stoke troubling a home side looking to return to Europe’s elite competition next season. Mark Hughes, however, does have a wild card in Saido Berahino who is set to make his first Stoke start. Graham Searles	16/17

Claudio Ranieri’s exit has given this match a new subplot but the central issue has not changed. The champions are in the bottom three and badly need a victory. Paul Chronnell	16/17

Another win would surely lead to Craig Shakespeare being given the job until the end of the season. Hull, however, beat Leicester on the opening day and would move level on points with the champions if they can complete the double over them. Stuart James	16/17

Jürgen Klopp will be aware of some pressure growing regarding Liverpool’s slide this year and that may continue without Jordan Henderson. Klopp’s side with the England midfielder win 61.5% of matches and just 33.3% without. Graham Searles	16/17

As Liverpool play Arsenal on Saturday evening one side, at least, will drop points. This means that, should José Mourinho’s side defeat Bournemouth, they will definitely start the week in fifth whatever the result at Anfield. United last lost in the league at Chelsea in October so this will be a difficult ask for Eddie Howe. Jamie Jackson	16/17

Last Sunday’s capitulation at Tottenham was not a good look and the frustration is that Stoke, while well-off in mid-table, never seem quite able to make that next step. The next few weeks will most likely see them shuttling between a nondescript set of places in the middle; should they be hoping for more, or is this their natural ceiling? Nick Ames	16/17

Swansea won at Burnley on the opening day, although that result was no indicator for what was to come for either club, with Sean Dyche’s side excellent at home ever since. Luciano Narsingh is pushing for a start for Swansea, while Jeff Hendrick returns from suspension for Burnley. Stuart James	16/17

However, it was no one but the Italian who replaced the injured forward Mauro Zárate with a midfielder at half-time in last week’s draw with West Ham. Zárate is out for the season with knee ligament damage and the Hornets will assess the fitness of Daryl Janmaat who also limped off against the Hammers. Saints will look to bounce back after losing the EFL Cup final when two Manolo Gabbiadini goals were not enough for Claude Puel. Paul MacInnes	16/17

However, the former England manager who, like Pulis, has never been relegated from the Premier League, is sure to be equally focused. Preparation may not be enough, though, as West Brom are enjoying their best-ever spell in the Premier League and will not want the party to end here. Graham Searles	16/17

That quartet of victories all came in league games but it is hard to imagine David Moyes’s side winning this one. Not that Fabio Borini is remotely deterred. “Manchester City seem a bit shaky at the back because of the way Pep Guardiola wants them to play,” says the Sunderland forward who believes his side can exploit this perceived fragility before celebrating a rare win.

But the bigger picture is the meeting between a Tottenham side that has come to look unbeatable at White Hart Lane and the division’s form side in Everton.

Crowd trouble marred a fine win for Slaven Bilic’s side and it was a surprise to see this match moved to a late kick-off. West Ham, who will be hoping that Andy Carroll will be fit enough to replace the suspended Michail Antonio up front, will be desperate for the focus to remain on the pitch.

If that is to materialise then Everton must win on Saturday. West Brom are chasing too, a record points total for the club in the Premier League. Tony Pulis’s miserly defence need to be at their best to keep on track and keep out a man they know all too well, Romelu Lukaku. Graham Searles	16/17

Swansea were relieved to win last week and their former Spain forward Fernando Llorente, in his best form of the season, is an aerial threat. Conrad Leach	16/17

Now comes a really difficult game, as some would have you believe, but if Jürgen Klopp’s team do not win this there will be some serious head scratching. Sean Dyche’s side will defend in numbers but have not won away this season in any competition. Their best result was October’s goalless draw at Old Trafford; a low was losing at Watford.

Josh King’s hat-trick in a chaotic encounter with West Ham gave Eddie Howe’s side their first league win of 2017 last weekend following an eight-game barren streak. Swansea have lost their past three away matches, since winning at Anfield, and travel without key full-backs Kyle Naughton and Martin Olsson. Joel Rabinowitz	16/17

Successive wins and clean sheets have given them heart but Patrick van Aanholt’s absence is a blow. Watford have won once away from home since mid-October but are within touching distance of safety and can tap into their hosts’ anxieties. Dominic Fifield	16/17

Hull overcame Merseyside opponents with a 2-0 win over Liverpool in February and Marco Silva’s side will need a similarly robust display to take anything away from Goodison Park, where the hosts have lost just once all season in the league.

Burnley, though, are anxious to register a first away win and will sense opportunity at the home of their bottom-placed hosts. Moyes’s plan for Jan Kirchhoff to play a role has been dashed, the influential midfielder has been ruled out for another four weeks. Louise Taylor	16/17

The Frenchman’s side arrive after a bruising run of three defeats in their past four league matches and at risk of being cut adrift from the top four. West Bromwich, however, were complacent in defeat at Everton last week and will need to be much more focused to avoid another one. Joel Rabinowitz	16/17

Leicester City cannot afford to take their eye off the ball in the Premier League. Three points above the bottom three, they remain in a relegation fight despite reaching the Champions League quarter-finals thanks to Tuesday’s win over Sevilla. Craig Shakespeare will be confident of extending his winning start and West Ham United’s indifferent recent form means a fourth straight win for Leicester could be on the cards. Jacob Steinberg	16/17

Instead Steve Agnew is auditioning for the job of keeping Boro in the top tier and could do with choreographing a first league win since mid-December. To that end he can only hope United are fatigued in the wake of their Thursday night Europa League exertions. Louise Taylor	16/17

The last time he was unavailable, they won two out of five in the league, drawing the other three but it still felt as though he was badly missed. Would a similar run now be enough to keep them in pole position for a Champions League finish?

Relegation looks very unlikely and the fixture list is, after this, relatively kind. For the visitors it is a chance to steal a further march on at least one of Manchester City and Arsenal, who trail in their wake and play each other on Sunday. Nick Ames	16/17

So imagine how discontented Arsenal fans will be with the embattled Arsène Wenger if he does not claim the trophy. The two league games between these sides ended in victory for City in December and a draw earlier this month. City are seven points ahead of Arsenal in the top flight having played one more match and they enter the tie as favourites. Yet it would be no great surprise if the erratic Gunners turn it on when required. Jamie Jackson	16/17

They will need all that confidence if they are to overcome Chelsea, who have lost away from home in the top flight only twice this season.

Steve Agnew conceded he “didn’t get the balance quite right” so it will be interesting to see whether Boro’s manager reverts to 4-2-3-1 or sticks with 4-4-2. One thing seems certain though; should the home side fail to beat a Burnleyteam still seeking their first away league victory of the season relegation will surely beckon. Louise Taylor	16/17

They have lost their last three although Mark Hughes has been at pains to suggest this is their most difficult run of the campaign. Relegation is the faintest of concerns but one more victory should banish any such thoughts and set their sights towards the top half once more. At least Liverpool, vulnerable after drawing with Bournemouth and losing Sadio Mané for the rest of the season, are not as daunting a prospect as they might have been. Nick Ames	16/17

What did he make of Antonio Conte’s suggestion that Chelsea had to win whereas it was more of a bonus for Tottenham? “Not interested,” he shot back. “If Chelsea don’t win the Premier League, it will be tough for them to accept,” he added. But Pochettino was interested only in his side keeping up the pressure, against a Watford team in the midst of an injury crisis. David Hytner	16/17

The visitors, one place behind them, have little to play for but remain a yardstick. “Southampton are a fantastic model … they are a top-10 team and they have some brilliant players,” Pulis said.

Leicester’s prospects of a seventh successive victory in all competitions since the departure of Claudio Ranieri have been enhanced by an Everton defence depleted by injury and suspension. Matthew Pennington will replace the suspended Ashley Williams at centre-back with Ronald Koeman claiming: “If we win our next two home games we can challenge for fifth or sixth.” Andy Hunter	16/17

David Moyes will aim to put this week’s controversy behind him by somehow masterminding a victory against his former club but, despite apparently prioritising the Europa League, José Mourinho presumably has very different ideas.

The Welshman’s volley is scuffed, but Dave Swindlehurst’s flick takes the ball scuttling beyond static defenders and into the net. Terry Venables’ side withstand second-half pressure and the majority of a crowd of 42,699 departs elated. It is 10 November 1979 and Crystal Palace have achieved what remains their only home victory over Arsenal. Arsène Wenger could not have picked a better venue to seek to build on his team’s midweek win. Dominic Fifield	16/17

The challenge here is to maintain standards against the champions and to climb further from the condemned near the foot of the table. Leicester City will arrive in south London effectively safe and presumably with one eye on Tuesday’s return leg against Atlético Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals. The hosts will hope they are a team distracted. Dominic Fifield	16/17

Everton have won their past seven home matches while Romelu Lukaku has scored in eight consecutive Goodison games – a feat last achieved by Fred Pickering in 1965. Ross Barkley is available having suffered no serious injury when attacked in a bar last weekend and Ronald Koeman is expecting a cagey affair. “It will hard to create open chances against them,” the Everton manager said.

It will be interesting to see if Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, nurtured by Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich and described by Puel as the “future” of Southampton, keeps his place against the side managed by his former mentor now that the club captain, Steven Davis, is approaching full fitness.

The goalkeeper is likely to be on the bench, particularly as Shay Given is a doubt with a minor back complaint. Hull, who have dragged themselves out of the bottom three with a remarkable revival under Marco Silva, have won away from home only once all season but will fancy their chances against a team who have lost their last four games.

Bilic, who could do with a win here as he endeavours to convince West Ham’s board that he remains the right man to lead them next season, may yet succeed in recruiting the England striker this summer, while Lamine Koné, David Moyes’s key centre-back, is another name on his shopping list.

He says the prospect of Tottenham finishing above Arsenal is not on his mind and nor is ramping up the pressure on the leaders, Chelsea. Yet victory here would put both notions into sharper focus. Bournemouth could be forgiven a measure of trepidation – they have found a bit of form but Tottenham appear unbeatable at White Hart Lane. David Hytner	16/17

A horror run of one point from five games has put Paul Clement’s side back in the bottom three after an initial revival under their new manager. Watford, with a defence hampered by injury and suspension, lost 4-0 at Tottenham last week and look vulnerable but Swansea were abject at West Ham and need to shed their anxiety if they are to prosper.

After he called out all five attackers fielded in Thursday’s 1-1 draw at Anderlecht, Sunday’s question is how they will respond against Chelsea. To hear Zlatan Ibrahimovic named in this group was a surprise as without his 28 goals how dismal might United’s season have been? Jamie Jackson	16/17

That is probably a good mindset for a visit to The Hawthorns, where Tony Pulis’s side easily duffed up Arsenal last month and will be sure to test the Merseysiders’ defensive resolve.

The only side in English league football not to have registered a win during 2017, their last top-flight victory (against Swansea) was on 17 December. Wenger meanwhile acknowledges that a top-four finish represents “a massive challenge” for his stumbling team, conceding “we might do it, we might not”. The odds on both he and Boro’s Steve Agnew remaining in charge of these clubs come August appear pretty slender. Louise Taylor	16/17

If that miracle is to occur, it must start with a win on Saturday followed by another against Sunderland in midweek. Anything else will surely leave Steve Agnew’s side with too much to do given their nightmarish run-in. Rich Flower	16/17

Watford are not mathematically safe on 40 points and have some difficult fixtures to come before the end of the season but a 12-point cushion should be enough to ensure their safety.

The games are starting to run out. Clement will have earmarked this one as a good bet for three points and a wildly unpredictable Stoke, for whom Jack Butland could make a long-awaited return from injury, could just as easily oblige as hammer another nail in their coffin.

Slaven Bilic’s options have been limited by Andy Carroll’s groin injury and suspensions to Sam Byram and Mark Noble, while another concern for the manager must be Romelu Lukaku’s record against his side. The Everton forward has scored in each of his past nine matches against the Hammers. Jacob Steinberg	16/17

There is no prospect of a repeat, at least in terms of early departures and managerial isolation, with Liverpool in pursuit of Champions League qualification. Joe Gomez could make his first Premier League appearance of the season with Joel Matip, Ragnar Klavan and Lucas Leiva struggling, although Mamadou Sakho’s ineligibility against his parent club represents a greater loss to Palace.

Yet one more win should ease the lingering nerves at both clubs, and the visitors will hope to exploit Crystal Palace’s crippling injury list at centre-back. Much may depend on how Palace recover from their midweek exertions against Tottenham Hotspur. Dominic Fifield	16/17

This could bode ill for Mark Hughes, especially after the Stoke manager spoke of “raised expectations” among fans. The visitors will miss the physical presence of Andy Carroll in attack and will be hoping their record signing, André Ayew, can fill the void. Rich Flower	16/17

Everton may be mediocre on the road but they revel in the comforts of home, winning their last eight, with Romelu Lukaku scoring 14 goals in his last nine Goodison appearances. Tottenham will crave a ninth straight win for Ronald Koeman’s team ahead of the north London derby but another wild Conte celebration would be more than justified should Chelsea prevail.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic (two) and Paul Pogba scored United’s goals but both are injured now. Given that eight players are unavailable, including the suspended Marouane Fellaini, José Mourinho is down to the bare bones before Thursday’s Europa League semi-final trip to Celta Vigo.

But the Spurs manager is surely about to dismantle it. Win the derby and Spurs will finish above their neighbours for the first time in 22 years. Pochettino wants more.

They are nine points clear of relegation, with three games remaining but a much bigger prize looms, a top-half finish. In-form Joshua King, who has scored 12 goals in his last 14 appearances, will again look to showcase his talents against a Stoke team who have not won on the road since January. Ben Fisher	16/17

One more point would take them to the vaunted 40 mark and they should fancy their chances of gaining at least that against a West Brom side that, with four consecutive defeats and five games without a goal, has tailed off dramatically. Six places and five points separate the sides but it is not entirely fanciful to imagine Burnley making that ground up over the final few games. Nick Ames	16/17

David Moyes has intimated he is staying at Sunderland and knows what has to be done to get them back up, which suggests a mass clear-out. Mark Tallentire	16/17

With Jamie Vardy scoring freely, Leicester are marching on under Craig Shakespeare and targeting a top-10 finish.

Either way, Everton’s visit seems like must-win territory for Paul Clement’s side, who have regained some confidence by beating Stoke and then drawing at Old Trafford last Sunday. Everton, on the face of it, have little to play for and their away record – winless in their past six matches – is nothing to write home about. Swansea, though, have never beaten Everton at home.

This will be the seventh meeting between the sides in the past two seasons. Liverpool have won only once so far, a 6-1 rout in the Capital One Cup, and have not scored in three games against Claude Puel’s team this term. Philippe Coutinho is on course to recover from the dead leg suffered at Watford on Monday, with the home needing to hold their nerve in the race for Champions League qualification. Andy Hunter	16/17

There will be no let up from the league leaders with the finishing line in sight, though Antonio Conte will be wary of the potential absence of David Luiz and N’Golo Kanté after knocks. “There will be two teams desperate for a result on Monday,” said the Italian. “For this reason, we will see a really good game on Monday.” Dominic Fifield	16/17

The Catalan believes Leicester will again try and counter-attack but he will also have known that in the pre-Christmas game.

While Claude Puel, puzzlingly “under pressure” on the south coast intends to convince his board to keep him on next season, Steve Agnew, Boro’s interim boss is hoping against hope that, come August, he might still be in charge in the Championship.

But the Potters have won only once in their last nine games and a bottom-half finish looks increasingly likely. That will only count as regression when Mark Hughes’s performance is assessed at the season’s end but they can at least show that some things remain the same with a rousing performance against opponents that tend to bring the bet365 Stadium to life.	16/17

Hull’s predicament – chasing Swansea with a notably inferior goal difference to boot – means they simply have to win. Their away record is the worst in the division, but Palace are the most obliging at home with 11 defeats to date. A 12th would thrust them to the brink of the Championship given a final day trip to Old Trafford. Nerves will be frayed. Dominic Fifield	16/17

Southampton’s form has also been underwhelming with one win in seven and Claude Puel faces questions over his future. Both sides have a point to prove and will be eager to give their fans something to cheer. Southampton will be without Shane Long who has a broken metatarsal. Freddie Paxton	16/17

Tony Pulis will be hoping to arrest an alarming slump that has seen West Brom fail to record a victory since 18 March. Rich Flower	16/17

Recent results have been awful for Watford with the club on for their longest losing streak in 44 years if they fall to City. Walter Mazzarri’s farewell could be brief after never really ingratiating himself with fans. Graham Searles	16/17

Have they seen the last of Alexis Sánchez? When will they be able to field their first-choice defence? But it still appears to be a more stable environment than the one in which they began last season. They lost, crucially as it turned out, to Liverpool on the opening day; Arsène Wenger knows a fast start is important this time around to make the idea of a new beginning more sellable and he will be buoyed by aspects of the Community Shield performance against Chelsea. His team look especially lively down the flanks: can they conjure up a nerve-settling early goal for their big signing, Alexandre Lacazette, or will Leicester’s own new boy Kelechi Iheanacho steal the show?

A previously slow summer of transfer activity stepped up this week with the arrivals of Davy Pröpper from Ajax and, imminently, the Club Brugge winger José Izquierdo but City have left most others in the dust when it comes to expenditure during this window and Pep Guardiola will want his own side to set down a marker early on.

César Azpilicueta will switch to the right with the new signing Antonio Rüdiger coming in to the back three. Álvaro Morata, another new recruit, will lead the line now Diego Costa is out of favour. Burnley will miss Michael Keane in defence while Jon Walters will have a tough task replacing Andre Gray up front. Rich Flower	17/18

The rebuilding of Everton and Stoke may be incomplete but both managers have the immediate task of getting a new-look team to gel. Next up for Koeman are Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United so a good start is imperative. Andy Hunter	17/18

Neither the Southampton captain, Virgil van Dijk, or Swansea City’s playmaker, Gylfi Sigurdsson, will feature with question marks over their futures. Saints’ record signing, Mario Lemina, could make his debut after joining from Juventus on Tuesday and Pellegrino’s other summer signing, Jan Bednarek, could also feature. The 19-year-old striker Tammy Abraham is expected to lead the line on his full Swansea debut. Ben Fisher	17/18

Liverpool are also without Adam Lallana and Daniel Sturridgedue to injury. They travel to Vicarage Road uncertain of what kind of opponents they will face in Watford, now managed by Marco Silva and with seven new signings jostling for places. One of those, record transfer Andre Gray, looks certain to start up front in the absence of the injured Troy Deeney while Nathaniel Chalobah is likely to anchor midfield after permanently returning to the club where he played on loan five seasons ago.

Tony Pulis’s side took only two points from their last nine games and have not won since mid-March. Do not bet against Pulis, the arch-pragmatist, rectifying that in this match against Eddie Howe’s improving but still unpredictable side. Paul Chronnell	17/18

One of the draws was November’s 1-1 with West Ham so what José Mourinho does not want is a repeat. Losing to Slaven Bilic’s side would be unthinkable but having spent £75m on Romelu Lukaku, £31m on Victor Lindelof and around £40m on Nemanja Matic this should not occur. Jamie Jackson	17/18

No matter; this remains an enticing, and intriguing, fixture, particularly as Spurs will presumably want revenge for their 5-1 thrashing here in May 2016. Given the chasm in quality between the two squads few are respecting a repeat of that scoreline; indeed Benítez would probably be happy with a point in front of another full house.

Jermain Defoe could make his first start for Bournemouth since May 2001 and Jordon Ibe may return to the starting lineup. “We need to get our momentum going and get our tempo going and if we can do that then hopefully we will get a result,” Howe said. Watford, who drew 3-3 with Liverpool in their entertaining season opener, should have their captain, Troy Deeney, available following groin surgery. Ben Fisher	17/18

It took them 18 games to win away last season and now they have recorded one at the first attempt, at the home of the champions, no less. Expectations will be high at Turf Moor but Tony Pulis’s side are unlikely to fall apart like Chelsea. The two sides appear evenly matched, and while Albion’s away form is not great either, it would not be an enormous surprise to see the points shared, as happened last season when Burnley came back down to earth after their win at Crystal Palace.

Leicester let victory slip through their fingers against Arsenal while Brighton could only hold out for so long against Manchester City. Keeping Jamie Vardy quiet will be the main task for Brighton after the England international scored twice in a superb individual performance at Arsenal. Kelechi Iheanacho, who was signed from Manchester City to play alongside Vardy, remains troubled by a toe complaint. Izzy Brown, who has a hamstring problem, is out for Brighton. Stuart James	17/18

A 3-0 home defeat by newly promoted Huddersfield Town represented a galling start for new manager, Frank de Boer, who also lost Wilfried Zaha to injury, while Liverpool will be looking to build on a valuable Champions League play-off win at Hoffenheim on Tuesday. That exhausting first leg may prompt changes by Jürgen Klopp before next week’s return, though his options appear limited. Andy Hunter	17/18

Ryan Bertrand has recovered from a knock, while Cédric Soares should start despite reported interest from Chelsea. Southampton are under new ownership and insist that Virgil van Dijk will stay, although the Dutchman remains unavailable for this game. For West Ham, Michail Antonio is fit again after four months out with a hamstring injury. Slaven Bilic will be targeting defensive improvement against a team without a home goal in six league games.

The winger is expected to be involved at some stage against Arsenal, 4-1 winners here in May and eager to secure a return to Europe’s elite club competition after finishing fifth last season.

Mourinho’s only real selection dilemma revolves around whether he should set up a bit more conservatively away from home and recall Ander Herrera. As for Swansea, they are still without Fernando Llorente, who is building up his fitness after breaking an arm. Roque Mesa could make his debut in place of Leon Britton, who is struggling with a back problem. Stuart James	17/18

Victor Moses is back following a ban but the Chelsea manager will also be hoping Pedro and summer signing Tiémoué Bakayoko come through fitness tests otherwise his squad, with 26 players out on loan, will be stretched to the limit.

Pep Guardiola’s default system may now be a back three which is why the West Brom central defender Jonny Evans is being pursued. The last time City faced Ronald Koeman’s side they suffered a 4-0 defeat at Goodison Park. The corresponding home league game was a 1-1 draw City dominated, so the manager will hope that match, not January’s reverse, is an augury of Monday’s meeting. Jamie Jackson	17/18

Bournemouth are point-less and yet to score in the league, although a midweek EFL Cup win at Birmingham has given Eddie Howe a welcome selection problem. “The positive thing from the week is that several players played well,” the Bournemouth manager said. “I’ll have to think hard about the team I pick.” Ben Fisher	17/18

The mood around both clubs suggests another awaits them. Neither has scored a league goal yet. Palace and their new manager, Frank de Boer, will be without Ruben Loftus-Cheek, his best player to date, and must find a way of coaxing some form from Christian Benteke if they are to kickstart their campaign.

If Rafael Benítez has problems, so does his opposite number. Slaven Bilic is well aware of the persistent rumours suggesting West Ham would not be averse to replacing him with a Newcastle counterpart openly unhappy with Mike Ashley’s transfer market parsimony.

Yet that was a win inspired by Eden Hazard, a player now feeling his way back after an ankle operation, and the visitors are much changed these days. A sterner test awaits this time with the visitors steeled and the champions still to be properly strengthened before the transfer deadline. It would not take a lot to bring a summer of frustration back to the surface. Dominic Fifield	17/18

Arsenal, on the evidence of their defeat at Stoke City plus Liverpool’s attacking display against Hoffenheim, need both back immediately. Jürgen Klopp’s side recorded a league double over them last season, scoring seven times. The form of Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané even without the service of Philippe Coutinho looks ominous for a visiting defence who, for all the talk at the end of last season, have changed little.

Mauricio Pochettino has urged his players to look at the overall performance in the 2-1 defeat to Chelsea rather than the scoreline. He maintains it was good, featuring enough creativity and merely lacking cutting edge. Victory feels essential this time. David Hytner	17/18

Regardless Pulis’s new signings have hit the ground running and, with the addition of Oliver Burke from RB Leipzig, Stoke could be fearing defeat at the Hawthorns. Mark Hughes will hope the shine from his side beating Arsenal has not worn off just yet. Graham Searles	17/18

The outpouring after the 4-0 humiliation at Liverpool last time out was visceral and everybody knows it will be replicated if they were to lose against Bournemouth – a club that is so far without a point, despite some encouraging performances. For the sake of humanity, Arsenal surely have to win. David Hytner	17/18

There was some encouragement from their performance at Watford before the international break, with Anthony Knockaert making his first start. The worry for Chris Hughton will be that he was not able to sign a forward, which would have added some extra firepower. There were boosts, though, for Shane Duffy and Davy Pröpper who scored for the Republic of Ireland and Holland respectively. However, with Jonny Evans likely to make his first start, West Bromwich will be confident of extending Albion’s goal drought. Jack Kinnersley	17/18

Neither will feature this time and while Tottenham are bullish as Harry Kane moves into September, the Everton manager’s failure to sign a targetman means he will be hoping Wayne Rooney is not affected by his drink-driving charge. Mark Tallentire	17/18

Antonio Conte must also decide what sort of role Eden Hazard plays now he is available after returning from ankle surgery. Leicester are unable to call on the services of Adrien Silva, who remains in limbo after Fifa refused to approve his transfer from Sporting Lisbon. Robert Huth and Vicente Iborra are also sidelined, although Aleksandar Dragovic, signed on a season-long loan from Bayer Leverkusen, could feature. Stuart James	17/18

Manchester City and Liverpool each harbour title hopes so this should offer a gauge of how close they may go. Last season’s corresponding match ended 1-1 and two years ago City suffered a 4-1 thrashing. Expect either manager to be jubilant with a mere 1-0 win. Jamie Jackson	17/18

Virgil van Dijk is still at the club but this match will come too soon for him. The centre-back Wesley Hoedt could make his first appearance for Saints. The end of the window was less happy for Watford and following Nordin Amrabat’s unexpected departure André Carrillo may take his place on the wingFellow new signing Marvin Zeegelaar and the fit-again Daryl Janmaat and Younès Kaboul give Marco Silva more options in defence.

Even if the Austrian slots in well, United look to have the attacking power to find holes in the home defence, especially out wide. The probability, therefore, is that if Stoke are to disrupt United’s 100% start, then Jack Butland is going to have to show the form that has convinced many that he should be England’s No1.

They beat Crystal Palace home and away last season, though not easily, and are bound to find Frank de Boer’s side a different proposition, if only because the visitors are desperate to register their first points of the season, or even their first goal.

Newcastle, in contrast, are not sure whether Rafael Benítez will be in the dugout to make any decisions – the Spaniard underwent surgery this week in relation to an infection following a hernia operation. Jonjo Shelvey, a former Swansea player, is available after serving a three-match ban. David Hytner	17/18

Fraser Forster gifted the hosts an early goal and Pardew won breathing space, albeit for only three weeks. Now, with Pardew, Sam Allardyce and Frank de Boer gone, Roy Hodgson will seek a result just as emphatic. Mauricio Pellegrino had been courted by Palace over the summer only to end up at St Mary’s. Given the upheaval of the last week, he may not know what to expect in south London. Dominic Fifield	17/18

Burnley had to wait until 29 April for their first away win last season but they have already collected four points from trips to Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur. Adding to that tally at Anfield would compound a tough week for Jürgen Klopp. Andy Hunter	17/18

His return means Mark Hughes can expect a warm welcome. José Mourinho may have declined to shake the Stoke manager’s hand last weekend but Benítez is a Hughes fan. “I don’t have any problems with Mark,” he said. “He’s a good manager, doing a great job. There won’t be any problems.” Louise Taylor	17/18

Paul Clement can take heart from how his team have played away from home of late. He knows he needs something special. David Hytner	17/18

In reality, the circumstances are entirely different this time round. Currently in fourth place with three clean sheets out of four, Watford should be difficult to break down. Indeed, Marco Silva’s side will go top of the league, for a day at least, if they were to win. Joe Cooper	17/18

Tony Pulis’s side are in need of a response after their good start to the season was derailed following a 3-1 defeat to Premier League newcomers Brighton and it could help that West Ham have conceded 10 goals in three away matches.

They will cling to the success gained against Antonio Conte’s side in the FA Cup final, and the Community Shield, but will surely find this a more daunting assignment. Chelsea have quietly been building up a head of steam, and they eased beyond Qarabag in midweek with key players rested and an eye on this derby. Conte will consider this an opportunity to make a statement in terms of his side’s title defence. Dominic Fifield	17/18

The issue though is whether Everton can arrest a run of three consecutive defeats against a Manchester United side out to return to winning ways in the league after their 2-2 draw at Stoke City.

The home side will be looking to bounce back after their Carabao Cup exit to Leeds United in midweek, as well as to re-establish fortress Turf Moor after picking up five of their eight points so far away from home.

A more youthful, balanced Everton side ended a run of four defeats with victory over Sunderland in the Carabao Cup in midweek but Koeman is likely to ring the changes again, having viewed last Sunday’s 4-0 defeat at Manchester United as a step forward.

Craig Shakespeare is likely plotting a classic counter-attacking display from his side, to prey on their opponents frailties, and to record a third successive win against Liverpool for the first time since 1963.

City are joint-top on 13 points and have a goal difference of 14, so expectations of a romp at the Etihad Stadium by Pep Guardiola’s team are realistic. Jamie Jackson	17/18

Captain Steven Davis has called on Southampton fans to get behind them at a venue where United have won nine times in 12 visits. The trip to St. Mary’s is the first of six away games for United in the next month, and José Mourinho may seek to rotate his attacking options before the trip to CSKA Moscow, with Anthony Martial in form.

Chelsea will be without David Luiz, their fourth sending off this season. “Maybe they haven’t quite got the dark arts right on spec at the moment.

Marco Silva’s side, however, have won both of their away games this season while Swansea are pointless and goalless at home. Paul Clement could decide to give Wilfried Bony his first start since returning and Roque Mesa is also pushing for a starting place. Watford, meanwhile, are still without Sebastian Prödl and Younes Kaboul, both of whom are injured, and the suspended Miguel Britos. Stuart James	17/18

But Lanzini’s unavailability boosts Tottenham’s chances of revenge. While West Ham have kept three consecutive clean sheets, Mauricio Pochettino’s side have won their first two away games without conceding a goal. Jacob Steinberg	17/18

Has their impressive form merely masked Rafael Benítez’s transfer window frustrations or is something significant gathering speed? Their former manager, Chris Hughton, will put that to the test and Brighton will need to beknow his side need to be as good as they were in their last home game, when Pascal Gross inspired them to a 3-1 win over West Brom.

Wenger vs Pulis is the ultimate clash of styles and how Wenger has suffered in away matches against his rival. The Emirates story is different. Wenger’s record there against Pulis teams reads: played 10, won 10. David Hytner	17/18

Eddie Howe will be without Harry Arter and Tyrone Mings, but Callum Wilson has returned to training after a second serious knee injury. Like Howe, Craig Shakespeare can point to respectable performances in tricky fixtures so far, but Leicester will fall into the relegation zone with defeat on the south coast. Jamie Vardy is set to be available despite a hip problem, having scored three goals in six appearances against Bournemouth. Niall McVeigh	17/18

Yet the visitors will still arrive at Stamford Bridge brimming with attacking intent, and Antonio Conte’s side, rejigged or not, will need to rescale the heights of their display at the Wanda Metropolitano to check the leaders’ progress. The suspicion is this could actually end up as fascinating a duel between Conte and Pep Guardiola as the players out on the field. Dominic Fifield	17/18

United are fresh from Wednesday’s emphatic 4-1 over CSKA Moscow and are second in thePremier L eague only on goal difference, while Palace still search for a first goal and first point after suffering a 5-0 hammering at Manchester City last Saturday. There should, surely, be only one result. Jamie Jackson	17/18

Mark Hughes does have hope in Southampton’s inability to score with any frequency but his crisis may be the jolt Mauricio Pellegrino’s attackers need to spark them into life. If Stoke do lose again they risk falling into the relegation zone. Graham Searles	17/18

In all competitions they have scored more than one goal once in eight attempts and that was against Accrington Stanley. Pulis was adamant his side deserved more at Arsenal but the Welshman’s protestations mask his side’s lack of creativity. Watford have no such problem and will be confident they can maintain their impeccable away form, that has yielded nine points from nine, despite missing Nathaniel Chalobah, who requires knee surgery after fracturing a patella.

Bilic desperately needs a win after last week’s defeat to Tottenham and it is likely to be a tense afternoon at the London Stadium. Swansea have lacked a goal threat this season, but they held Spurs and have been tough to break down away from home. Jacob Steinberg	17/18

Thus, for most, the pacy Ademola Lookman and Kevin Mirrallas cannot start soon enough. The defence is out of form too, and Burnley will fancy their chances. Mark Tallentire	17/18

Sean Dyche will need to record his first Premier League win over West Ham to restore Turf Moor to the fortress it once was, Slaven Bilic’s side have won all four meetings in Burnley’s last couple of seasons at the top level.

Even in the absence of Álvaro Morata and N’Golo Kanté, they will travel south across the capital and confident Crystal Palace, pointless and scoreless to date, can be overcome. The hosts must do without Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Christian Benteke, but will at least be bolstered by the return of Wilfried Zaha and possibly Julian Speroni to their ranks. At some point they must revive. It may be too much to ask for the recovery to start against Chelsea. Dominic Fifield	17/18

Marouane Fellaini and Paul Pogba are big misses for Manchester United but Sadio Mané’s absence will be felt by Jürgen Klopp, too. Liverpool’s performances have not been as bad as recent results indicate but they can ill-afford to fall 10 points behind their arch rivals so early in the season. Both sides have opportunity to deliver a statement of intent. Andy Hunter	17/18

Factor in how Pep Guardiola’s side beat Chelsea without the striker and they could not be rolling any smoother. A caveat can always be found though: in last season’s corresponding fixture Stoke achieved a creditable 0-0 draw so Mark Hughes knows how to gain a result at the Etihad. Jamie Jackson	17/18

Marco Silva’s side have not won yet at home and Arsène Wenger’s have not won away from the Emirates. However, it is surely Arsenal that should be more confident, despite in all likelihood missing Alexis Sánchez, of breaking their duck after not conceding a league goal in September. Petr Cech will need to be at his best to keep another clean sheet though as Richarlison is going to be eager to continue impressing. Graham Searles	17/18

Then again international breaks can sometimes provide timely punctuation and Ronald Koeman will hope his team come out refreshed after taking stock of a deeply unimpressive and troubling September. The television audience in India, who are the beneficiaries of this game’s switch to 1.30pm on Sunday, will doubtless be hoping for a rousing contest too. Everton’s travelling fans would be forgiven for focusing their attention on this latest demonstration of the Premier League’s priorities. Nick Ames	17/18

Pellegrino has no new injury concerns after the international break, with Shane Long recovering from a hip problem. Newcastle are boosted by the permanent signing of the midfielder Mikel Merino while Jonjo Shelvey is available despite a finger injury. Niall McVeigh	17/18

The combination of Danny Drinkwater’s late departure and the embarrassing mix-up over the signing of Adrien Silva has left Leicester light in midfield, yet other areas of the team are also not clicking. West Brom, in contrast, were quick out of the blocks, picking up seven points from their first three matches, but have failed to win since. Stuart James	17/18

Antonio Conte’s side are clearly struggling to adapt to the fixture clutter generated by the Champions League. The visitors’ start will be fuelling their own European desires, with Watford having taken 10 points from four away games to date.

Townsend’s old manager, Rafael Benítez, may be more concerned by Wilfried Zaha as he aims to ensure Newcastle bolster the feel-good factor engendered by much fevered take-over talk and collect three points themselves. Roy Hodgson describes Zaha as his “talisman” but Palace’s challenge is to prove they are no one man team. Louise Taylor	17/18

Southampton have won only once at St Mary’s this season, while West Brom are winless in their past six league games. Mauricio Pellegrino will be looking for a repeat performance from the inconsistent Manolo Gabbiadini after his double against Newcastle, while goalkeepers Ben Foster and Boaz Myhill both face late fitness tests for the visitors.

In-form Tammy Abraham should relish going up against a Leicester defence that has conceded nine in their barren run. It is likely to be an uphill struggle for Leicester with the players reportedly unhappy about Craig Shakespeare’s sacking. Robin Sargeson	17/18

Ronald Koeman’s side enter the corresponding fixture having won twice in 12 games and with their manager under intense pressure, though it is hard to envisage the repeat that Koeman desperately needs when looking at the attacking options at his disposal. Arsenal require a reaction of their own having been bullied into submission yet again at Watford last weekend. Andy Hunter	17/18

Mauricio Pochettino is happy with Tottenham’s performances, as there were many positives from their draw with Real Madrid at the Bernabéu. It will be tough for Liverpool to beat Spurs, who are undefeated in their past six games. Robin Sargeson	17/18

Arsène Wenger knows that patience will be a virtue but he has demanded that his players show pace and positivity in order to preserve Arsenal’s “impeccable” home record. After a few crashes away from home, he knows the margin for error is zero. David Hytner	17/18

Eddie Howe is pleased by his side’s upturn in form but even more will need to be squeezed from his players to avoid defeat. Jermain Defoe’s opportunity to score a 200th league goal could be the extra drop required. Graham Searles	17/18

West Ham’s dramatic comeback at Wembley on Wednesday lifted some pressure on Slaven Bilic while Crystal Palace are back at Selhurst Park for the first time since defeating champions Chelsea. West Ham, as one of four sides still winless away, will be hoping their cup form translates to the league. Jack Mumford	17/18

As Manchester City are five points ahead of United and Spurs, second and third respectively, a draw is surely undesirable and given the loss of Spurs’ star striker the onus is on José Mourinho’s men to go for the win. Considering Mourinho’s use of cat-and-mouse tactics it remains to be seen if he will instruct his side to do so. Jamie Jackson	17/18

The mood is much more solemn for Stoke City, sitting just above the relegation zone; they are yet to win away from home in this campaign. If Watford can match the energy they have displayed so far, the visitor’s barren run on the road may continue. Jack Mumford	17/18

Pep Guardiola made nine changes in midweek, against Wolves, and will want his key men to return to the West Midlands in relentless fashion. Tony Pulis’s only hope could be parking the bus but, without Craig Dawson and possibly Jonny Evans, that is likely to be a serious challenge. Graham Searles	17/18

They have met only once before at the Amex, Brighton winning 3-0 in the Championship, and with seven points from their last four games Albion will fancy a repeat. Mark Tallentire	17/18

Puel seems likely to keep faith with the Leicester team that ended a six-game winless run with victory at Swansea, which means Shinji Okazaki will play just off Jamie Vardy. Idrissa Gueye is back from suspension for Everton. Stuart James	17/18

So far Dyche’s side have beaten only Crystal Palace at Turf Moor, and have now slipped below Rafa Benítez’s team in the table. Newcastle will be confident after drawing their last two away matches, and with two conservative defences a draw seems the most likely result on Monday. Paul Wilson	17/18

Meanwhile their team could do with beating Bournemouth. With games against Huddersfield, Swansea and Burnley on the horizon, Simon Francis, Eddie Howe’s captain, has described November as “a make or break month”. The bad news for Howe is that Premier League Saturday matches at home suit Rafael Benítez, he has won his last 31 such fixtures, the most recent five during his Newcastle tenure. Louise Taylor	17/18

That might be easier said than done, with speculation growing that Sean Dyche is set to depart for Everton. Chris Wood faces a late fitness test on his hamstring, while Steven Defour should be available. For the hosts, Charlie Austin has recovered from a knock but Mario Lemina is out until after the international break. Mauricio Pellegrino’s side have lacked consistency, but could stretch their unbeaten run to four games if the visitors prove to be distracted. Niall McVeigh	17/18

They will be missing Renato Sanches, Martin Olsson and Leon Britton but Wilfried Bony has a chance of making the bench. Brighton, who look more comfortable in the Premier League after a run that has gleaned eight points from their past five matches, promise to be awkward opponents. Stuart James	17/18

They won 4-0 at the London Stadium last season and will back themselves to overcome the absence of Philippe Coutinho against a West Ham side who have been hit by an injury crisis in defence.

Antonio Conte, stung personally by that embarrassment, has conducted his own debrief and will expect a response from his side, but so much hinges on how N’Golo Kanté trains on Saturday and whether he declares himself fit to feature. The return of Nemanja Matic and, to a lesser extent, Juan Mata add another layer of intrigue to a potentially combustible occasion. Dominic Fifield	17/18

Ten defeats in 14 matches embarrass an expensive squad and those who assembled it, and fear will deepen around Goodison Park should Marco Silva’s Watford inflict an 11th. Unsworth has suffered three defeats in three difficult away fixtures with a hectic schedule disrupting his search for a settled side. Goodison will be firmly behind the club’s popular former defender but the unknown is whether Everton’s highly-paid, experienced players will finally take responsibility for the slide.

His schedule since taking over from Frank de Boer has seen meetings with the Manchester clubs and Chelsea, and now he runs into a Tottenham team flying after their midweek Champions League triumph against Real Madrid.

Leicester beat Manchester City 4-2 on that occasion, with Jamie Vardy scoring a hat-trick as Pep Guardiola’s side somewhat naively played into the hands of the then Premier League champions. Now City are an entirely different proposition and it is hard to see how anyone can stop a team that is unbeaten in 23 matches and scoring goals at a ridiculous rate.

Mauricio Pellegrino, who played 13 times for Liverpool in 2005, has maintained Southampton’s defensive discipline, since replacing Claude Puel, but scoring has been a struggle.

Their last outing was the defeat at Chelsea and, given how shrewd Rafael Benítez is, Newcastle United may provide a real test at Old Trafford.

Lee Grant starts in place of the injured Jack Butland for Stoke and Murray will be relishing facing the replacement, especially as Stoke have conceded an average of two goals a game this season and just one fewer in total than the league’s worst tally.

Roy Hodgson has overseen significantly improved performances over his side’s past five matches, yet the team have still won only once all term and are adrift at the foot playing catch-up from that wretched start. Stoke City, who have not won at Selhurst Park in a decade and are enduring their own inconsistencies, must surely be overcome if Palace’s confidence is to be bolstered before Tuesday’s derby at Brighton. This may be the time to fling Christian Benteke back into the fray from the start. Dominic Fifield	17/18

For the home side, post-Champions League fatigue may be more in mind than body after blowing a three-goal lead against Sevilla on Tuesday. A home win will take Jürgen Klopp’s side level on points with the champions but, Crystal Palace apart, Chelsea have impressed on the road this season – collecting 15 points from a possible 18 on their travels compared to 10 at Stamford Bridge. Mohamed Salah’s form will worry his old club. Andy Hunter	17/18

Until that happens there is a sense of limbo; not that Rafa Benítez can allow Newcastle, who have lost their past three games, to tread water. An intriguing tactical duel between Benítez and Watford’s Marco Silva – (much admired by managerless Everton) – will be spiced by the return of Newcastle’s Mikel Merino from injury.

Tammy Abraham will have to miss that game because of his loan agreement and is also a major doubt against Bournemouth because of a back problem. Eddie Howe’s side, with three wins from their past four league games, appear resurgent and will fancy their chances. Stuart James	17/18

He reshuffled the backroom staff and told the assistant, Ben Garner, to stay away, and is now trying to get a tune out of a team with four draws and six defeats from the last 10. Spurs at Wembley would not have been his game of choice either, even if he last featured there as a player with Sheffield Wednesday in 1988. Mark Tallentire	17/18

Fresh from victory in the north London derby, Arsenal will be hoping for more of the same at Turf Moor, yet Burnley could be fresher still by virtue of not having played in the Europa League.

David Wagner’s side have already toppled Manchester United at home this season but a repeat performance is a tall order against a City team who have won all of their away matches this season.

The visitors’ interim manager, David Unsworth, challenged his reshuffled Europa League team to give him a selection dilemma but Wayne Rooney, Sandro and Davy Klaassen weakened their case in the 5-1 defeat. Mauricio Pellegrino is under growing pressure with three league wins all season and may fast-track Mario Lemina back into his team with Oriel Romeu suspended. These sides were the “best of the rest” last season; that seems like a long time ago. Niall McVeigh	17/18

Newcastle, in contrast, have won only once since September and boast a solitary victory at Stamford Bridge since 1986. Their comeback at the Hawthorns on Tuesday offers some cause for optimism but Rafael Benítez, a Europa League winner as Chelsea’s interim manager, is braced for an awkward return.

David Moyes’s side suffered a 4-0 humiliation at fellow-strugglers Everton in mid-week, which included Wayne Rooney’s wonder goal, and will surely not fancy facing Manchester City away.

If the return of Christian Atsu - a winger possessing the pace collectively lacking in the side - and captain Jamaal Lascelles is welcome, Rafael Benitez’s players will need to be mindful of Leicester’s dangerous counter-attacking. With Sam Allardyce’s Everton in Toon on Wednesday and Mike Ashley having discussed a club sale over a Hampstead curry with Amanda Staveley this is a potentially pivotal week on Tyneside.

Jürgen Klopp is the only Liverpool manager in history to win his first three derbies, his team have plundered 12 goals in two games and look perfectly equipped to prey on Everton’s many weaknesses. Sam Allardyce has a decent derby record overall but it will require a stunning transformation – from both sides – to trouble Liverpool’s unbeaten home run against their rivals, one that stands at 17 league games.

Despite each manager’s public platitudes José Mourinho and Pep Guardiola know a victory for their side will have a seismic effect on the title race. If the Portuguese’s Manchester United can cut the gap to five points it gives them belief and boosts Chelsea, who are a further three points back. Lose and the Catalan’s Manchester City would return to their base in the east of the city cock a-hoop due to a near four-wins advantage. Jamie Jackson	17/18

Mauricio Pellegrino is expected to stick with in-form striker Charlie Austin despite Shane Long recovering from a calf problem as he looks to improve that record. Arsène Wenger will be without defender Shkodran Mustafi but Theo Walcott, who scored a hat-trick against his former club in January’s FA Cup win, should be available despite a tight calf.

But Newcastle United have been unable to stop their slump; it is now seven defeats in eight and, unsurprisingly, the nerve ends on Tyneside are raw. A visit to Arsenal does not seem like the best medicine but Arsène Wenger’s side are also jittery. David Hytner	17/18

The latter is a particular concern; their only goal in the past five games has come from the penalty spot and Burnley will take some imagination to break down. Sean Dyche and company have set a standard for teams in Albion’s position: at worst Saturday may be a useful learning exercise. Nick Ames	17/18

Yet Chelsea expect their visitors to be stung by that loss, and therefore much improved from the lethargic mishmash which succumbed too easily on the south coast. “The coach, the club, the players don’t want to extend a bad run, and will want to give a response against a team like Chelsea,” said Conte. “Manchester City only beat them recently in the 96th minute.” The champions will be wary.

A problem Roy Hodgson has to solve though is Palace’s goal tally of zero from eight away games. Leicester, meanwhile, have only failed to score once at home this season against Manchester City. Hodgson should be very wary of baiting Claude Puel’s revitalised Foxes. Graham Searles	17/18

The smart money, though, says Saturday will be the day as City are 18 points better off and flying. If Spurs can worry the home side through pace, though, as Liverpool did in September before Sadio Mané’s sending off, they may have a chance of handing City a first league defeat. Jamie Jackson	17/18

They have kept two consecutive clean sheets since Joe Hart vanished from the goalmouth. David Moyes will be delighted those blanks took four points from meetings with Chelsea and Arsenal but should also be wary of his side’s confidence growing too rapidly. Stoke City have no such conjuring to call on and fans will fear their record-worst start to a Premier League season rolls on. Could Tony Pulis be on his way back to the Potteries?

After stuttering to draws at home to Everton and then West Brom, they now face Eddie Howe’s side, who on home turf have a habit of giving the bigger sides a fright – if not worse – as in this fixture last season when Bournemouth came from 3-1 behind to take victory. Klopp could again make changes – Simon Mignolet may return in goal – while Howe, too, has said he will rotate owing to the hectic festive schedule. Ben Fisher	17/18

How Paul Clement could do with a similar turnaround. Swansea remain bottom of the table following a lesson by Manchester City, although they are not the only team to suffer that fate this season, and have not won away in the league since August. Their recent home win over West Brom, however, demonstrates there can be no complacency at Goodison Park. Andy Hunter	17/18

Watford’s early lustre under Marco Silva has faded; they have lost four of their past five – seven of their past 10, looking further back – and among today’s long list of absentees is the influential Abdoulaye Doucouré. Chris Hughton must make one change himself, with the centre-back Shane Duffy suspended, and the home side will hope to build on last weekend’s good showing against Burnley in their bid to avoid a harsh winter.

The visitors will be anxious to put the 4-1 defeat at Manchester City on their last trip to the north west behind them, while the home side will be missing ever-present James Tarkowski for the next three matches, the defender having picked up a retrospective ban for elbowing Glenn Murray at Brighton.

Eden Hazard may lead the Chelsea attack with Álvaro Morata suspended after collecting a fifth booking of the campaign in midweek for celebrating his wife’s pregnancy. Everton’s new manager made no apologies for an ultra-defensive display away at Liverpool recently but whether another can be deployed at Goodison Park in a bid to protect his unbeaten start is questionable.

The Premier League champions are 16 points behind Manchester City and their domestic season is now a sprint towards Champions League qualification.

While all eyes strain for a sight of Liverpool’s statement of intent, however, Jürgen Klopp’s focus will be on breaking a barren run against Claude Puel.

The runaway leaders have won six of their past seven games at Selhurst Park in all competitions and will confront a depleted Crystal Palace side with Roy Hodgson sure to rest players before Tuesday’s trip to Southampton. Quite why that fixture could not have been moved back a day remains a mystery, but bBe braced for Hodgson’s pragmatism to prompt another round of knee-jerk accusations that the Premier League is becoming increasingly uncompetitive.

Fire as many balls into the box as often as possible from wide areas, set pieces, goal kicks and throw-ins. Why not even punt it in from kick-off? Arsène Wenger’s lamentable defence has no answer for such tactics at present and concede more than two goals on average in the league when they are breached. Fortunately Wenger still has Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez to bail him out of trouble. Graham Searles	17/18

Despite transforming Crystal Place’s fortunes since his arrival in September, the former England manager is now confronted with a mounting injury list that has left his squad looking extremely threadbare. Jeffrey Schlupp and Andros Townsend are the latest to miss out, while Burnley counterpart Sean Dyche must make do without top scorer Chris Wood as his side return to London having already beaten Chelsea and drawn with Tottenham in this campaign.

Throw in mounting uncertainties about Newcastle’s mooted takeover and Benítez looks to have almost as many problems as Swansea’s Carlos Carvalhal before a relegation six-pointer both managers could desperately do with winning.

Yes. Free-flowing, attacking prowess? No. Sam Allardyce has done what he needed to do and what was expected of him since taking charge at Everton but even he says his team have not been good enough in the final third. The manager hopes the £27m signing of Cenk Tosun can help – the striker scored against Tottenham for his previous club, Besiktas, in the Europa League in 2014. Tottenham, by contrast, are in form and scoring goals. David Hytner	17/18

Alan Pardew has an ideal chance to build on that against Brighton and to spark a revival as Chris Hughton’s side have scored just five goals on the road this season.

Arsenal are winless in four in all competitions – their longest barren run since a streak of five starting in February 2016 – and that could easily continue. Eddie Howe can count on making chances with ease against Wenger’s notional defence and that could be enough as the burden of Arsenal’s successes may no longer be able to lie squarely on Alexis Sánchez’s shoulders. The dream of an easier life in Manchester may prove too much of a distraction even if he does play. Graham Searles	17/18

A key date in the season for both clubs, he says. “City used the momentum and we suffered,” the Liverpool manager said. “We should try to draw a different picture.” Klopp’s side have the form to threaten the league leader’s unbeaten start to the season, having not lost themselves in 13 league games, and City have not won at Anfield since May 2003.

Arsenal must block them out against Roy Hodgson’s resurgent Crystal Palace. What was most disturbing for Wenger’s team in last Sunday’s defeat at Bournemouth was the sterile possession and lack of creativity. Palace will look to be compact. Arsenal must find the answers.

The reverse fixture on Boxing Day saw Sean Dyche’s side take a two goal lead at Old Trafford, before Jesse Lingard salvaged a point for United with two goals. Lingard’s heroics have become a recurring theme for José Mourinho’s team, but Burnley have not won at home since early December so the England international may not be leaned on quite as heavily.

Theo Walcott will add some much needed pace and will oppose his former team-mate Kieran Gibbs. West Brom picked up three crucial points against fellow strugglers Brighton last time out and must go into this game with the same positive approach. A win could move Alan Pardew’s side to 17th, should Southampton lose to Tottenham at St Mary’s. Reuben Pinder	17/18

Watford, on the face of it, should be obliging opponents for Leicester. Marco Silva’s side have been in freefall, with their only victory in their past 10 Premier League games coming against Leicester on Boxing Day. Stuart James	17/18

Such are the fine margins in the Premier League’s crammed lower reaches. West Ham are on an upward trajectory after thrashing Huddersfield Town and will be confident of gaining revenge for Callum Wilson’s controversial equaliser in their 3-3 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day. Yet the visitors are only a point behind David Moyes’s side after their battling win over Arsenal. It could be a nervy afternoon. Jacob Steinberg	17/18

Tottenham are unbeaten in five while Southampton’s winless league run stretches to 10 games – including a 5-2 Boxing Day thrashing by Spurs. The home side’s only win over Spurs since returning to the Premier League came in May 2016, and was also their last league win over a side in the current top six. Mauricio Pellegrino’s focus now is on the bottom six – Southampton play the other five teams presently in that bracket in the next seven games, so anything gained on Sunday will be a bonus.

Liverpool put five past them on Boxing Day, two days before Carvalhal was appointed, and their 4-3 victory over Manchester City last weekend provided more evidence of their devastating attacking ability. Mohamed Salah has recovered from illness in time to face Swansea and Virgil van Dijk is also available again. Renato Sanches is back in contention for Swansea. Stuart James	17/18

The hope is the shake-up can re-energise the club. One thing Arsène Wenger wants to maintain is his side’s impressive home form. He is vexed by the wild contrast to their away results. Walcott may fancy vexing him some more after helping Everton to end a wretched run on Wednesday with two goals in the win over Leicester City. David Hytner	17/18

Eddie Howe’s side face Stoke City, who could hand new recruit, the Senegalese midfielder Badou Ndiaye, his debut.

The visit of West Ham, blighted by injury and off-field problems, looks like a good opportunity to end their six-match winless run. Record signing Jürgen Locadia is not ready for involvement just yet, although he has begun training, but Leonardo Ulloa should get some minutes on returning to his old home. Brighton are approaching the stage where they need a hero, and perhaps the Argentinian will be that man. Nick Ames	17/18

The runaway leaders can expect a tough game but should have more than enough attacking invention to prevail despite not signing Riyad Mahrez. Paul Wilson	17/18

How unsettling that whole episode has been for Leicester, who are unbeaten at home since mid-December, remains to be seen. Swansea are unlikely to be able to call on new-signing Andre Ayew, who is a major doubt, but Carlos Carvalhal’s side will travel with confidence after back-to-back wins over Liverpool and Arsenal.

However Southampton’s victory earlier in February at the Hawthorns could serve as excellent motivation. Revenge would be sweet and Alan Pardew will be focused on earning a quarter-final spot that could spark his side into life for a tilt at Premier League survival. Graham Searles	17/18

Hodgson has now lost Bakary Sako to a broken ankle, a sixth long-term absentee, until into next season and may have to turn sooner than he would have liked to his three young new signings. A year ago, Sunderland came to south London and won 4-0. Newcastle will hope to repeat that trick. Dominic Fifield	17/18

Since that 4-1 reverse, however, Jürgen Klopp’s side have lost only once in 16 league games, scoring 43 goals in that period, and arrested a recent dip with victory at Huddersfield. Only two points separate the teams in the race for Champions League qualification and it would be a significant step towards that goal for Liverpool should they repeat the heights of their last home league display against Manchester City.

Antonio Conte was basking in leading Chelsea to the title in his first season while Watford secured the services of Marco Silva ahead of a host of other suitors. Wind the clock forward nine months, however, and things have unravelled both in west London and Hertfordshire, with Silva gone and replaced last month by Javi Gracia and Conte seemingly talking his way to the exit door at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea do, however, remain in the top four but Spurs are breathing down their necks and Conte’s side could use a return to winning ways on Monday after the disastrous defeat to Bournemouth.

Sam Allardyce owes one to Hodgson having not contacted his England predecessor personally in the 17 months since being caught mocking his speech. Everton’s players also need to atone for their apology of a performance, and latest in a series of capitulations, at Arsenal last weekend. Palace are missing nine senior players through injury and Goodison Park will be short on forgiveness should Everton fail to capitalise on their good fortune. Andy Hunter	17/18

How things have changed for Leicester City and Riyad Mahrez since the latter tore City apart in the same fixture two years ago during the Foxes’ title-winning season.

Sean Dyche’s side have not won in a Premier League game since December but they remain awkward opponents – only the two Manchester clubs have conceded fewer goals this season. Carvalhal could give debuts to André Ayew and Andy King, while Stephen Ward is fit again for Burnley. Stuart James	17/18

Javi Gracia is settling in nicely after replacing Marco Silva and Watford visit a West Ham side who are three points above the bottom three after last weekend’s defeat at Brighton.

They must also find more creativity. Having slid down the table they are nearing the time when every match will be described as a must-win. But Bournemouth, who seemed to be in similar straits until winning two on the trot, have shown how quickly moods can improve, thus representing inspiration, as well as a threat, for David Wagner’s men.	17/18

Might Slimani be capable of scoring the goals needed to ensure Benitez’s team avoid relegation? Will Mourinho win a Premier League game at St James’ Park for the first time?

Virgil van Dijk became the sixth and last of them in January, and the £75m Dutchman is assured of a rough reception from the home crowd for the manner of his departure, while Adam Lallana, sent off in midweek for the under-23s, may find a place on the bench. Southampton won last week, a six-pointer at West Brom, and are likely to be unchanged with Mauricio Pellegrino, a former Liverpool defender himself, conscious of the need to back that up with another three points as five of their next six league games are away from home.

They are not the team to confront when the head coach’s job is on the line, as André Villas-Boas and Roberto Di Matteo might attest. Antonio Conte has seen his side beaten by three goal margins in their last two fixtures, with a top four finish under threat. Alan Pardew’s visitors have a more appealing run of games after Monday, but their own comeback must start somewhere. Why not Stamford Bridge? Dominic Fifield	17/18

Both teams ought to be revitalised after a two-week break and need to hit the ground running on their return to action, with the visitors, in particular, still looking over the shoulder. Jermain Defoe could make his comeback from an ankle injury, most likely from the bench, for the hosts. ”He’s trained and I’m pleased with what we’ve seen, he’s a natural goalscorer,” Eddie Howe said.

Chris Hughton will hope Jürgen Locadia can pick up from where he left off against Coventry and provide the attacking threat his side have lacked at times this season.

Mahrez, however, is set to make his first league start for more than a month here. Stoke, who will be without the injured Peter Crouch, are second from bottom and have not won away for four months.

Mohamed Salah has scored 17 goals in his last 16 league appearances and in each of Liverpool’s past five games. Daniel Sturridge was the last Liverpool forward to score in six successive outings back in February 2014.

Mauricio Pochettino will sense this as an opportunity to take advantage of Manchester United and Chelsea’s match above them, and Arsenal’s distraction in the League Cup final.

With only one set of three points away from home all season, at Newcastle, Everton under Sam Allardyce are not in great shape either and both sides might settle for a draw. Paul Wilson	17/18

Leicester have had a little wobble of late, picking up only two points from a possible 12, but Claude Puel’s side should be boosted by the return of Shinji Okazaki, who is available again after being sidelined with a knee injury.

Liverpool have scored more goals and won more home games against Newcastle than any other team in the Premier League era – 89 and 17 respectively – and, in Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah, have two forwards in outstanding form. Salah is bidding to score in a seventh successive game, a feat last achieved at Liverpool by Daniel Sturridge in 2014, while Firmino has 15 in his last 18 starts. Andy Hunter	17/18

Carlos Carvalhal’s side will move out of the relegation zone and level on points with David Moyes’s team if they can rack up a seventh successive home victory in all competitions. Andre Ayew looks set to make his first start for Swansea since re-signing from West Ham in January and what chance the Ghanaian marks the occasion with a goal?

Gerard Deulofeu’s broken foot provides some hope as the Spaniard had hit the ground running and provided relief from Javi Gracia’s long injury list.

Arsenal now, if they didn’t quite before, look completely broken and Brighton will be rubbing their hands with glee, not just for warmth, at the very realistic prospect of an important win in terms of their survival. Glenn Murray has four goals in his past five appearances in all competitions and should be able to brush off Arsenal’s atypical defence with ease if given the chance. Graham Searles	17/18

This match may come too soon for Wilfried Zaha to start for Palace but he has been the scourge of Chelsea in recent times. The hosts, with four defeats in their past five league games and Wednesday’s trip to Camp Nou looming large, will hope to have the job done before Zaha can be summoned from the bench.

Goodison Park may well be hostile – “We are absolutely aware of that,” Allardyce said – but there is also need for unity, however temporary, with Stoke away, Manchester City and Liverpool on the horizon. Brighton have the capacity to increase Allardyce’s problems. Chris Hughton’s side are unbeaten in seven games and are above their big-spending opponents in the table. Andy Hunter	17/18

A run of five successive defeats speaks for itself but they have performed miracles to stay in the league before. Leicester, though, will be confident they can easily add another to that tally, with the superior attacking qualities of Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy, while snapping their winless run of five matches.

If Sean Dyche’s side can also triumph at West Ham on Saturday they can move to within two points of sixth-placed Arsenal. Joe Hart, meanwhile, has been thrown a World Cup lifeline by David Moyes. The goalkeeper’s England spot for this summer’s tournament in Russia has been in jeopardy since he lost his place at West Ham in December following some inconsistent performances. But Moyes said: “Joe Hart will start.” Paul Chronnell	17/18

Arsène Wenger’s players might want to prove a point to him but, really, the oomph has been knocked from their Premier League season. It is now the Europa League or bust. Watford have won three out of their past four matches. As ever, the mood at the Emirates will be a sub-plot. David Hytner	17/18

However while Pep Guardiola’s side are the heavy favourites to win again – a repeated destruction is unlikely. Paul Lambert has brought back Stoke’s once-lauded defensive stability. They have conceded four in six games with the Scot in charge compared to 50 in the 23 preceding games this season, which provides hope in more important fixtures to come. Graham Searles	17/18

A seventh in succession feels likely for Alan Pardew’s side, despite Gareth Barry and Jonny Evans returning, and a win for Bournemouth would give them one of the three required to confirm a fourth season in the top flight. Is there a risk of complacency for Bournemouth? “Absolutely no chance,” said Eddie Howe. Graham Searles	17/18

Who we are, what we want to achieve, what we can get,” Allardyce said. Stoke, who lost their free-hit to Manchester City 2-0 on Monday, see this as a match they can and must get three points from and with games running out, will be confident they have the wherewithal to further bamboozle Everton.

Chris Hughton does not quite see Brighton’s position that way and hopes their next two games against Huddersfield and Crystal Palace banish any lingering relegation concerns. The omens look good: they have won their past four home matches in all competitions and pack a far greater punch in attack than earlier in the season. Nick Ames	17/18

That should spur Jürgen Klopp’s side on, even with this a nuisance of a game before the more anticipated contests against Manchester City and Everton to come. Palace, with their ranks of wounded still too numerous for comfort, will hope Christian Benteke and Mamadou Sakho have points to prove against their former club. Dominic Fifield	17/18

Three points will offer City the priceless opportunity of winning the Premier League title at home to Manchester United next weekend. It is an opportunity not to be wasted, although Wednesday’s Champions League quarter-final at Liverpool may influence Guardiola’s selection.

Next up for United is Manchester City when Pep Guardiola’s side could claim the title at the Etihad.

Javi Gracia will demand a response against Bournemouth, after conceding eight and failing to score in their past two matches on the road, but equally should have confidence in his side’s ability to bounce back based on their strong home record this season. Richarlison’s lack of form is a concern though. The Brazilian scored his first goal for Watford against Eddie Howe’s side in August but has failed to find the net since November. Graham Searles	17/18

Much has changed since and Burnley have a club-record 43 Premier League points while West Brom are 10 adrift of safety and all but relegated. “I kind of feel I owe this club,” said Alan Pardew, who has only one league win to his name since arriving at the Hawthorns in late November. “The results since I’ve been here should have been better and I’d like to come back next season with a squad that better reflects the way I play, with a bit more attacking prowess.” Burnley have won their last two games – Everton and West Ham – and with only 14 away goals conceded will be disappointed if they do not make it three in a row.

They have not played since then and extra security measures will be in place for the visit of Southampton, who will push 17th-placed West Ham into the bottom three if they win. Mark Hughes has said he wants to use the crowd against the home team. Jacob Steinberg	17/18

Roy Hodgson’s side may have received a blessing in disguise though through Christian Benteke’s lack of fitness. The Belgian striker has scored only two goals this season. Someone else having a chance to be the focal point of Palace’s attack could be the difference between survival and relegation. Bournemouth look safe but Eddie Howe remains focused on not letting up until his side’s Premier League status is confirmed. Graham Searles	17/18

Everton are enduring the worst run in their history against Liverpool – 16 derbies without a win – and while confidence and form is soaring on the other side of Stanley Park Jürgen Klopp must ring the changes before next week’s Champions League rematch at the Etihad Stadium.

With 35 points on the board, another victory would all but secure their Premier League status. Leicester remain hopeful of finishing the season in seventh, although Claude Puel will have to rejig his midfield after losing Matty James to injury and Wilfred Ndidi to suspension.

Paul Lambert has had a host of problems to address before the visit of Tottenham, including Saido Berahino’s time-keeping, Ibrahim Afellay’s attitude and an interview in which Xherdan Shaqiri was quoted bemoaning the lack of quality at Stoke. That is hardly the ideal preparation for Spurs, who have beaten Stoke by four goals in their past four meetings. Lambert has introduced a little more solidity since replacing Mark Hughes but they still do not look capable of a clean sheet. Paul Doyle	17/18

Ashley Barnes’ contribution of four goals in four has been a huge part of their recent success and that could well continue because Watford have conceded 10 goals in their past three matches. Javi Gracia will be looking for his side to build on their improved showing last week against Bournemouth with a win that would equal their points tally last season. Graham Searles	17/18

Carlos Carvalhal’s mission to save the club can get back on track against West Brom who are now 11 points adrift with six games to play. However who knows what change Alan Pardew’s exit could bring. The relief for the players of a manager’s tactics that were failing absolutely could be enough to inspire an unlikely victory despite survival hopes approaching the academic stage.

Helpfully their 4-1 demolition of CSKA Moscow on Thursday also makes the trip to Russia next week much more appealing than it might have been. Arsène Wenger’s side should be in relaxed mood and able to fire on all cylinders. Southampton’s chances of securing a much-needed win look bleak after failing to score in their past three league matches. Graham Searles	17/18

Chelsea suffered a fourth home defeat of the campaign last weekend, rendering their pursuit of the top four forlorn, and they may have surrendered their title by kick-off. These are difficult times for Antonio Conte. West Ham were buoyed by that restorative thrashing of Southampton, but are hardly clear of the relegation scrap just yet as they pursue a first win across the capital since September 2002.

Six points currently separates the two sides, a gap that could easily increase as Burnley enjoy the luxury of good home form and a stress-free run-in. Paul Wilson	17/18

This team’s greatest shortcoming this season has been up front where analysis by Gracenote Sports, taking into account the quality and frequency of chances created, suggests they should have plundered 52 goals, rather than their measly 33. Benteke’s projected goal tally was 12. He has two. Brighton, relatively solid all season, will seek to blunt their bitter rivals and hope their hosts depart pining for Glenn Murray.

Mohamed Salah requires one more league goal to reach 30 for the season, and has scored 11 times in his last six matches at Anfield, but his game-time may be restricted against Bournemouth after he returned from a groin problem to play a starring role in the midweek European defeat of Manchester City. Liverpool need three more goals to record 300 in all competitions under Klopp. Andy Hunter	17/18

That was only 18 months ago. Both teams have unravelled this season and head into a league and cup double-header wondering where another defeat will leave them. Southampton’s plight is more pressing and with five tricky-looking fixtures to follow, Mark Hughes must aim for better than the narrow defeat to Arsenal. He will be without the suspended Jack Stephens but at least has in-form strikers to choose from – Charlie Austin and Shane Long both scored at the Emirates, with Long expected to recover from an ankle problem.

Jordan Ayew, Swansea’s leading goalscorer, returns from suspension and will go straight back into the team, possibly at the expense of Tammy Abraham. For Everton, Wayne Rooney is expected to start, with Sam Allardyce insisting there is no problem between them after he substituted the forward last weekend, but there will be no Liberty Stadium return for Gylfi Sigurdsson, who remains injured.

They should have no problems cuffing aside West Brom, but if Pep Guardiola’s men have already won at Tottenham on Saturday it will be close to immaterial. Still, second place is definitely on for José Mourinho’s men and that would represent a four-place leap from last season. Jamie Jackson	17/18

Roy Hodson’s side will draw level with them, and take a huge step towards safety, if they do. Hodgson should be confident after Palace flourished in attack to beat Brighton last week. Four Watford players may miss out with a stomach virus too. Javi Gracia has not named two of the ill players which suggests he is not feeling confident about his side’s chances. Graham Searles	17/18

With Jürgen Klopp surely focused on Roma at Anfield on Tuesday and Champions League football next season all but secured, it is a possibility. However it does feel like rather a large stretch of the imagination for the bumbling Baggies to best Liverpool despite needing to win to maintain their already incredibly slender hopes of staying up.

The onus will be on Jonjo Shelvey to show the watching Gareth Southgate that he is worth considering, and trusting, for a late inclusion in England’s World Cup squad. For Sam Allardyce, the visit of his former club brings reminders of an unhappy spell at St James’ Park and a massive pay-off. With Evertonians calling for something similar at Swansea last weekend, albeit in harsher terms, he could do with another home win to keep the restless supporters at bay. Andy Hunter	17/18

Sean Dyche’s side have suffered just one defeat from their past eight games, and will prove to be a difficult task for a Brighton side who have struggled away from home this season. Chris Hughton’s men are winless since their back-to-back successes against Swansea and Arsenal in early March. Joel Aberg	17/18

Claude Puel’s side will arrive at Selhurst Park having won only twice in 10 league games stretching back to January, without Kasper Schmeichel, and with the manager’s job beyond this season in doubt. Yet Roy Hodgson is still preaching caution in a bid to ward off any complacency. Palace, much improved, have lost only once to a side outside the top eight since September and must determine whether the time is apt to recall Christian Benteke. Dominic Fifield	17/18

David Wagner’s side, six points above the relegation zone, have taken 25 from a maximum 35 points at home this season, in comparison to Everton’s 12 from 45 on the road. Gylfi Sigurdsson is back in light training, but the Everton manager, Sam Allardyce, said the Iceland international is still “a way off” making a first-team return anytime soon. Joel Aberg	17/18

Stoke have never won a top flight league game at Anfield and Jürgen Klopp’s side are unbeaten at home in the Premier League this season. The Liverpool manager must rotate before next week’s second leg against Roma and the visitors simply have to capitalise with only three matches of their season remaining. Andy Hunter	17/18

Meanwhile Rafa Benítez has announced that talks over his future on Tyneside are under way. Newcastle’s manager has only a year left on his contract and will want assurances as to the summer transfer budget before extending it. “We’ve had conversations and we’ll have more conversations next week,” said Benítez before stressing that a quick resolution would be “better for everybody”.

With matches against Everton and relegation rivals Swansea following this, they have the chance to make up ground before the final-day visit of Manchester City. Hughes will be without playmaker Sofiane Boufal – he is training with the youth team after falling out with the manager. Eddie Howe will still be unable to call upon Adam Smith, who is close to a return, as his visiting side look to assert their south-coast supremacy. Niall McVeigh	17/18

Swansea have collected 13 points from their past five home games, beating Liverpool and Arsenal in the process, but they have injury problems at the back, with Federico Fernández and Kyle Bartley doubtful. Chelsea, who are looking for a third successive away win in the league, are still without the suspended Marcos Alonso. Stuart James	17/18

The champions look determined to keep standards high and they scored nine goals in two visits to the London Stadium last season. They will fancy their chances against West Ham, who are still not safe from relegation after last weekend’s thrashing at Arsenal. David Moyes’s team will require a perfect defensive performance to stand any chance of denying City. Jacob Steinberg	17/18

Bournemouth should have a chance at turning their own abject streak around as Swansea have scored just two goals and are winless in their past seven games in all competitions.

Last week’s win against Bournemouth was only their second in 10 league games but it gave the fans hope and Mark Hughes will be looking to capitalise on that during the trip to Goodison, where the atmosphere has been eerily quiet of late. Sam Allardyce, like Hughes another merry-go-round perennial to take over in the dugout since Saints defeated Everton 4-1 in October’s reverse fixture, reckons he has won “the hearts and minds” of the Everton majority with their home performances and insists the dissenters are a vocal minority. Some were evident when Everton won their last home game, against Newcastle, with their only shot on target, but many were more so during the 2-0 win at Huddersfield later that week. With Allardyce already talking about his plans for the close season, some may even welcome the chance to clear their throats and get the banners out if Hughes produces the away win Saints crave.

Leicester have won only four of their previous 18 league games, they were booed off in the last home match and go into this fixture off the back of a 5-0 defeat at Crystal Palace with a long injury list. It has not exactly been plain-sailing lately for West Ham either but Andy Carroll is set to be involved after patching up his differences with David Moyes. Stuart James	17/18

A fourth successive draw would not be enough: Paul Lambert’s side must win this match if they are to have any chance of going into their final match of the campaign with survival still possible.

Javi Gracia has the potential to guide Watford to their best Premier League finish, as they sit level with their previous record in 13th, but their run of seven matches without a win will not have pleased the trigger-happy powers that be. Rafa Benítez has hinted, again, that he is prepared to move on if his masterful season is not rewarded with investment in the squad. Graham Searles	17/18

This feels highly unlikely, despite Darren Moore’s positive influence on the Baggies, as West Brom last beat Tottenham at the Hawthorns in 2008. Maurico Pochettino’s side are yet to secure a place in the Champions League next season and will be hungry to edge even closer to another crack at Europe’s elite with victory. Graham Searles	17/18

Burnley will not play the obliging guests. Were they to win, they could end up finishing sixth and squeezing Arsenal into seventh.

Antonio Conte’s side are clinging to the remote possibility of a top four finish, though the Italian did say Sunday’s game “could be a good opportunity to keep the hope alive”.

Three points to see out a memorable season would be nice, but Burnley already have a hugely impressive 54 and have put themselves into Europe for the first time since 1967. No one was expecting that, though as a result Burnley will be expecting interest in Sean Dyche to resurface again over summer. “It’s the price of success,” chairman Mike Garlick said.

Roy Hodgson’s feat in steering Crystal Palace to safety, despite a chronic injury crisis, having been pointless in mid-October has been remarkable. Darren Moore, even only in his capacity as a caretaker, has mustered 11 points from five matches, claimed the manager of the month award for April and endured relegation on Tuesday. The hope – and it is only a hope as yet – is he is given a chance to take up the reins on a permanent basis. Dominic Fifield	17/18

Preserve an unbeaten home campaign against a Brighton team that has won twice on the road all season and Liverpool are in the Champions League for a second year running. As a side note, Mohamed Salah needs one more goal to become Liverpool’s record scorer in a Premier League campaign. He is currently level with Luis Suárez’s 31 goals in 2013-14. Andy Hunter	17/18

Can he use it to somehow secure a top-four finish? Newcastle fans must trust this is not Rafael Benítez’s Tyneside swansong. The negotiations between their widely coveted manager and Mike Ashley over extending a contract that has only a year to run remain delicate. Expect the Gallowgate End to, not for the first time, repeatedly sing “Rafa Benítez, we want you to stay.” Chelsea meanwhile are monitoring Newcastle’s much improved centre-half Jamaal Lascelles. He could be key to Benítez’s team ending a run of four straight defeats as they struggle to retain their grip on 10th place. Louise Taylor	17/18

Mark Hughes would give his prospects of staying an added boost with a return against the club who sacked him in 2009 and he has urged Saints to make a quick decision for next season. “It’s a well-run club, good club, and a good opportunity for whoever gets it,” said Hughes who arrived only in March. If City win they will set more records, however, for the most away wins in a Premier League season with 16, and the most points on the road, 50. “In the last few weeks these numbers have helped us keep focus,” said Guardiola, whose players secured the title on 15 April.

Stoke are already condemned to the Championship and Swansea’s relegation will be confirmed at the final whistle. It promises to be a strange day, with Swansea fans planning to hold protests to vent their anger at the board and also turning up to say farewell to Àngel Rangel and Leon Britton, two club stalwarts. Stoke, like Swansea, will be glad when it is all over. Stuart James	17/18

Wayne Rooney, who has received an offer from DC United, is unlikely to feature because of a knee injury, so fans may have missed their chance to pay tribute to a legend. Moyes and Allardyce, on the other hand, are unlikely to be mourned if they are shown the door by West Ham and Everton respectively. Jacob Steinberg	17/18
