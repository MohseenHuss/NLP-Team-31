0	Arsenal	Sunderland	4	1	22/02/2014	14	Gus Poyet says the excitement at Sunderland has been reflected in the best week of training under his charge. The Capital One Cup final against Manchester City looms next weekend – Sunderland's first major final for 22 years – and there is also an FA Cup quarter-final at Brighton or Hull. Yet nothing matters more than Premier League survival and, with his team in the relegation zone, Poyet is desperate for a tonic. Arsenal want a response to the Champions League loss against Bayern Munich. David Hytner	1	-0.9547230005264282,0.3173554340998332
1	Chelsea	Everton	1	0	22/02/2014	14	Before a reunion with Didier Drogba in midweek, José Mourinho must focus on overcoming a spirited Everton side who defeated them at Goodison back in September. John Terry is back after a muscle injury and Gary Cahill is in contention despite a thigh problem. For Everton, Romelu Lukaku is ineligible against his parent club, while Steven Naismith will play some part after a head injury. Conor Davies	1	0.9953464865684509,0.02847188711166382
2	Crystal Palace	Manchester United	0	2	22/02/2014	14	This promises to be an awkward test for Manchester United, who cannot afford another defeat if they are to keep alive their diminishing hopes of finishing in the top four. Crystal Palace have been excellent at Selhurst Park since Tony Pulis's arrival, winning five of their seven home matches under the former Stoke City manager. Although Palace remain two points above the bottom three, they will fancy their chances of giving David Moyes another headache. United have found it difficult at this ground in the past.

3	Manchester City	Stoke City	1	0	22/02/2014	14	This visit of Stoke City is the last league game for Manchester City until 15 March due to the League Cup final, an FA Cup sixth-round and the international break so Manuel Pellegrini is keen for his side to sign off with a win. Despite the midweek loss to Barcelona in the Champions League, Pellegrini is confident his players will not be affected so Stoke may be in for a torrid time at the Etihad, where only Chelsea have taken any points from the home side. Jamie Jackson	1	0.9937049746513367,0.8850798606872559
4	West Brom	Fulham	1	1	22/02/2014	14	Felix Magath has always been known as a tough taskmaster and his first act after being handed the Fulham job last week was to order the players in for extra training. We will see this afternoon whether that worked but with only one point from the last six games, they need an instant response. West Bromwich, however, have the next worst recent run of form with three points from 18. Alan Smith	0	-0.9992745518684387,-0.003087550401687622
5	West Ham United	Southampton	3	1	22/02/2014	14	West Ham come into this fixture having won their last three games 2-0 but they have struggled in recent meetings with Southampton, having won just one of the last eight. Mauricio Pochettino's team, meanwhile, are unbeaten in six league games and will be looking to win a third consecutive away game for the first time in the top flight – after victories at Fulham and Hull. Alan Smith	1	-0.9819064140319824,0.9976733028888702
6	Liverpool	Swansea City	4	3	23/02/2014	14	Garry Monk's first visit to Anfield as a player ended in a 7-1 defeat with Southampton in January 1999 but, even with Liverpool prolific at home, he will be confident of an improvement on his first outing here as manager. Last weekend's FA Cup defeat to Everton was Swansea's first defeat in four matches under Monk. They have rediscovered their cohesion and energy in recent weeks but will need to be on peak form to withstand a Liverpool team smarting from their cup exit at Arsenal and sensing a title challenge under the former Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers. Andy Hunter	1	0.9520976841449738,-0.9959172606468201
7	Newcastle United	Aston Villa	1	0	23/02/2014	14	"Villa have just returned from a warm weather training break in Portugal. Paul Lambert can only trust it has done them more good than last month's trip to Abu Dhabi did Newcastle. Since returning, Alan Pardew's team have failed to score a goal while conceding 10 in their last three games. With only one win in nine matches and lacking a home victory since Boxing Day, Pardew is under pressure. ""Newcastle's crowd can become edgy,"" said Lambert. ""We've got to try to get their crowd against them."" Louise Taylor"	1	-0.00028856098651885986,0.9326671361923218
8	Norwich City	Tottenham Hotspur	1	0	23/02/2014	14	After a disappointing loss to West Ham United in their last outing, the Norwich manager, Chris Hughton, will be hoping to ease the pressure and he may have midfielder Jonny Howson returning from a back injury to help him. Tim Sherwood will welcome back Emmanuel Adebayor and Hugo Lloris after they were rested against Dnipro on Thursday as Spurs look to maintain their top-four push. Conor Davies	1	0.984499454498291,0.9994156360626221
9	Aston Villa	Norwich City	4	1	02/03/2014	14	Not a lot of love lost between these two clubs. Relations have been strained ever since Paul Lambert left Norwich for Villa in 2012 and time has not been much of a healer. A game full of subplots – Wes Hoolahan wanted to join Villa from Norwich in January while Grant Holt, who scored prolifically during his time at Carrow Road, is likely to be among the Villa substitutes – carries extra significance because both clubs are desperate for points to climb clear of the relegation scrap. Stuart James	1	-0.26853213707606,0
10	Cardiff	Fulham	3	1	08/03/2014	14	It has been another turbulent week at Cardiff City and one would feel with Everton and Liverpool next up, failure to get a result against the only team below them in the table would plunge Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team into a deeper crisis. Fulham's new manager, Felix Magath, reckons there is more pressure on Cardiff but, winless since January, they need to improve before it's too late. Alan Smith	1	-0.9975514113903046,0.9959090948104858
11	Crystal Palace	Southampton	0	1	08/03/2014	14	This, on paper, would appear to be one of Crystal Palace's more winnable remaining home fixtures this term as they attempt to move six points clear of relegation, though Tony Pulis' side remain saddled with a dreadful record against the division's current top-nine teams. The point earned at home to Everton remains their only reward in 12 games against the teams from Southampton up and, with Marouane Chamakh hamstrung, a lot will depend upon Glenn Murray hitting the ground running. The Saints will be buoyed by the international recognition gained by their players in midweek, though that may yet prove to have disrupted their preparations. Dominic Fifield	-1	0.9759817719459534,0.4011566638946533
12	Norwich City	Stoke City	1	1	08/03/2014	14	These are games Norwich need to get a result from if they are to stay up. Wes Hoolahan made only his sixth start of the season and scored within three minutes against Aston Villa last week so he should get the nod against a Stoke team minus Charlie Adam, who is banned for a stamp on Olivier Giroud. Mark Hughes' team are not safe either and defeat would see them overtaken by Norwich. Alan Smith	0	-0.990809440612793,0.9898226261138916
13	Aston Villa	Chelsea	1	0	15/03/2014	14	One must wonder how much longer José Mourinho will play down Chelsea's chances. On Friday he spoke of how they are ahead of schedule but refuses to acknowledge that with a seven-point lead heading into this weekend, Chelsea are one of the favourites for the title. Win against Villa, who have lost seven of their eight home games to teams in the top 10, and he must publicly recognise their credentials. Alan Smith	1	0.9993070363998413,-0.8493627309799194
14	Fulham	Newcastle United	1	0	15/03/2014	14	Alan Pardew begins his three-match stadium ban here and Felix Magath may soon find himself wishing he were not at Craven Cottage too. The German was plunged into a mess and his three games in charge have yet to produce any evidence that he can tidy it up. Fulham's best hope of getting their first win league win since New Year's Day could lie in the attitude of their opponents, but, after going through an indifferent spell, Newcastle have won their last two matches and seem to have their heads in the right places again. Paul Doyle	1	-0.3334643443425496,0
15	Hull City	Manchester City	0	2	15/03/2014	14	This time last week, Manchester City were in with a chance of an unprecedented quadruple. Now, with the League Cup already safely secured, they have only the Premier League to focus on. It will be intriguing to see how they bounce back following the defeats to Wigan and Barcelona but Hull will look to use the momentum gained from their FA Cup run to move closer to safety. Alan Smith	-1	0.984805166721344,0.9990297555923462
16	Southampton	Norwich City	4	2	15/03/2014	14	Southampton have won one of their last eight home games but will struggle to find a better chance to improve that run against Norwich whose away form – having lost the previous four away from Carrow Road – could yet be very costly. They are four points clear of the bottom three but do have a favourable run with Sunderland, Swansea, West Bromwich and Fulham after this. Alan Smith	1	0.0003428161144256592,0
17	Stoke City	West Ham United	3	1	15/03/2014	14	Stoke are without Jonathan Walters and Charlie Adam through suspension but are in good form, having lost just once – to Manchester City – in their last six. West Ham have lost once in five matches with Sam Allardyce named manager of the month in February. West Ham, who have conceded just one in their last four games on the road, have won and drawn in their last two league visits to the Britannia Stadium. Daniel Clark	1	0.9995743632316589,0.9021324217319489
18	Sunderland	Crystal Palace	0	0	15/03/2014	14	"Gus Poyet has dubbed this quintessential relegation six-pointer as ""bigger"" than Sunderland's Capital One Cup final against Manchester City and the season's ""most important game."" With Tony Pulis prone to packing Palace's defence and aiming to sneak a goal on the break before pulling everyone back behind the ball again, it will not be easy for Sunderland. Often low on creative guile, Poyet's team frequently struggle to score and so much may depend on whether Adam Johnson and Fabio Borini are in inventive and incisive mood. Louise Taylor"	0	0.2991260091463725,0.9832514524459839
19	Swansea City	West Brom	1	2	15/03/2014	14	Pepe Mel has mustered a mere four points since taking over at West Bromwich and will be without six members of his squad including the captain, Chris Brunt, while Nicolas Anelka has parted company with the club. Swansea are in a similar dire run, claiming three points from their last six games, but Garry Monk could welcome back Michu after a three-month injury layoff. Samar Maguire	-1	-0.5500751733779907,-0.9993618130683899
20	Manchester United	Liverpool	0	3	16/03/2014	14	If Liverpool want to establish themselves as perennial title challengers then winning at Old Trafford has to become a regular occurrence. Brendan Rodgers' team have a chance to start a new trend as the last time Manchester United lost at home to their fiercest rivals was the 4-1 humiliation of 2008-09. David Moyes remains resolute in the midst of a trying inaugural season in charge of the champions but with Liverpool 11 points better off a victory could prove pivotal in turning his team's fortunes around. Jamie Jackson	-1	0.9719836711883545,0.012254893779754639
21	Tottenham Hotspur	Arsenal	0	1	16/03/2014	14	"Tottenham have laboured in recent weeks and it feels as though they must win this one to keep their Champions League dream alive. They have a decent record at home to Arsenal of late and when they won the corresponding fixture last season, there was talk of their rivals being in a ""negative spiral"". Arsenal, though, fought their way back from the crisis, which has become a speciality of theirs. Blood and thunder looms. David Hytner"	-1	0.9991042017936707,0.0359976589679718
22	Chelsea	Arsenal	6	0	22/03/2014	14	"Arsène Wenger will take little satisfaction in overseeing his 1,000th match if the derby he has labelled Arsenal's ""game of the season"" is lost. This contest will go some way towards determining these clubs' respective title challenges, with the visitors aware that, if Wenger secures a first victory in 11 attempts over a team managed by José Mourinho, then a follow-up success at home to Swansea on Tuesday will send them top. Mourinho suggested this game was of no greater significance than last weekend's trip to Aston Villa, though that fooled no one. The loss of Willian and Ramires to suspension feels significant. Dominic Fifield"	1	-0.9969460964202881,-8.526444435119629e-05
23	Everton	Swansea City	3	2	22/03/2014	14	​A win would see Everton leapfrog Tottenham into fifth and, despite a lengthy list of absentees, the omens are good. Roberto Martínez's team have not only won their past seven games at Goodison Park, they have also beaten Swansea in five of the last six meetings. For Garry Monk's team, the threat of relegation looms large – they lie five points off the bottom – and points are required. Alan Smith	1	0.9992570877075195,0.006784558296203613
24	Hull City	West Brom	2	0	22/03/2014	14	Pepe Mel finally guided West Brom to victory in his eighth game by coming from behind at Swansea last weekend. But they must now build on that because, with Sunderland holding two games in hand, Mel's team are by no stretch of the imagination safe. Hull, with only one win in their past eight home league games, could still be dragged into the fight for survival, despite sitting 14th. West Brom would leapfrog Steve Bruce's team with a win, outlining how tightly bunched the bottom half of the table is. Alan Smith	1	-0.23473000526428223,0.034276872873306274
25	Newcastle United	Crystal Palace	1	0	22/03/2014	14	"The good news for struggling Palace is that Newcastle are without the injured Loïc Rémy for a seventh Premier League fixture this season. When the France striker, on loan from QPR, has been absent, Alan Pardew's team have lost five league games, drawn one and failed to score a single goal. ""Rémy's not our player but we struggle to score without him,"" acknowledged the one-time Palace midfielder who, because of a stadium ban, will watch the match on television at the training ground. Much may depend on if and when Hatem Ben Arfa is liberated from the home bench. Louise Taylor"	1	0,0.45096777379512787
26	Norwich City	Sunderland	2	0	22/03/2014	14	Another meeting of two sides struggling to keep their heads above water. Chris Hughton's future at Norwich is in a near constant state of doubt and if they are to maintain their Premier League status, they need results against the teams around them in the table. Sunderland, while third bottom, have games in hand due to their cup runs but that could yet prove their downfall as fixtures pile up. Alan Smith	1	-0.9994416832923889,-0.9984178841114044
27	West Ham United	Manchester United	0	2	22/03/2014	14	The picture is looking much brighter for Manchester United now. Wednesday's victory over Olympiakos in the Champions League has lifted the gloom for David Moyes after last Sunday's humiliation at home to Liverpool, although United will have to be at their best at Upton Park, a ground where they have often come unstuck. The doubts will return if United lose to West Ham, who are not quite clear of the relegation battle just yet. West Ham have lost their past two matches but this is unlikely to be easy for the champions. Jacob Steinberg	-1	-0.9683541655540466,0.8416330218315125
28	Aston Villa	Stoke City	1	4	23/03/2014	14	Aston Villa, buoyed by last week's surprise triumph over Chelsea, aim at Villa Park to make it three successive victories for the first time since October 2007. Hope can be taken from Stoke's poor away form – they have not won a league game outside the Potteries since August – and the fact that Charlie Adam and Jonathan Walters are suspended for the visitors and Stephen Ireland is ineligible. Anastasiia Tikhomirova	-1	0.9995319843292236,-0.9954066276550293
29	Tottenham Hotspur	Southampton	3	2	23/03/2014	14	Spurs restored some pride in the second half against Benfica on Thursday but, after the defeat by Arsenal last weekend, their aim of securing a Champions League place lies in tatters. Injuries have not helped Tim Sherwood's case but he will be desperate to end a four-game winless run at home to Southampton, whose England players remain determined to earn World Cup call-ups. Alan Smith	1	-0.9962688684463501,-0.9953435063362122
30	Arsenal	Manchester City	1	1	29/03/2014	14	Arsenal fans are worried, and little wonder. Injuries have hit and the team's confidence is fragile while they encounter a City side fresh from their humbling of Manchester United and who remain as most people's title favourites. Arsène Wenger has them down as the side to beat. Arsenal's manager might have to temper his natural instinct to get on to the front foot – City bite. The visitors still have to go to Liverpool but they see this as a key staging post. David Hytner	0	-0.4919525533914566,0.9951387345790863
31	Crystal Palace	Chelsea	1	0	29/03/2014	14	Victory in this derby may lack the resonance of last weekend's thrashing of Arsenal, but José Mourinho would still consider it critical. With Liverpool and Manchester City breathing down their necks, Chelsea can ill afford to slip up against a team without a win in five matches. Palace have scored only once, from a penalty, in that time, are without the injured Marouame Chamakh and have their eye on games with Cardiff and Aston Villa to come. Dominic Fifield	1	0.9974532723426819,-0.9992407858371735
32	Manchester United	Aston Villa	4	1	29/03/2014	14	David Moyes insists that the majority of Manchester United fans are behind him despite the midweek derby defeat and hiring of a plane by some to fly over Old Trafford to protest. The Scot concedes he needs to win matches so who knows what might occur if United go down to Villa in what would be a seventh home league defeat. That would be a club record in the Premier League era, beating the mark set just on Tuesday evening when City beat Moyes's side 3-0 and Sir Alex Ferguson was abused by some supporters. This is how dire proceedings currently are at the defending champions. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.585678905248642,0
33	Southampton	Newcastle United	4	0	29/03/2014	14	It says a lot about Southampton and Newcastle that there is likely to be more attention on the referee than them. Andre Marriner will be hoping for a quiet afternoon after his blunder during Chelsea's win over Arsenal last week and will be glad that Alan Pardew, whose stadium ban is over, is not allowed on the touchline yet. Newcastle's manager is looking forward to giving his team-talk after three matches away. But both sides are safe in mid-table, so this is likely to be a low-pressure affair. Jacob Steinberg	1	-0.24835854768753052,0.9923230409622192
34	Stoke City	Hull City	1	0	29/03/2014	14	With seven games to go, Stoke remain on track for a 10th-placed finish, their highest in the Premier League. Unsurprisingly, their home form has been the cornerstone of their relative success and with only two defeats at the Britannia all season, it would be quite surprising if Hull, who are similarly positioned in mid-table but could yet be dragged into a relegation fight, leave with a win. Alan Smith	1	0.9995003938674927,0.999309778213501
35	Swansea City	Norwich City	3	0	29/03/2014	14	Coming off the back of last week's 2-0 win against Sunderland, another victory could see Norwich go 10 points clear of the relegation zone. Despite being without a win in their last six league games, Swansea will have been buoyed by the late point they earned at Arsenal on Tuesday. Norwich have never lost to Swansea in the Premier League but their run of five consecutive away defeats makes this one hard to call. Romily Preston-Ellis	1	0.9947538375854492,0.002540290355682373
36	Fulham	Everton	1	3	30/03/2014	14	Fulham have seven matches to secure their Premier League survival and this threatens to be the hardest of the lot. Everton, with Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku seemingly revitalised after being rested by Roberto Martínez, appear to be gaining momentum and their pursuit of a Champions League spot means they will show no mercy to Felix Magath's men, who will likely have to produce their best performance of the season to avoid another defeat. Paul Doyle	-1	-0.9940012097358704,0.9946086406707764
37	Liverpool	Tottenham Hotspur	4	0	30/03/2014	14	Momentum is behind Liverpool in the title race, with Brendan Rodgers's team unbeaten in the Premier Lleague in 2014 and taking 32 points from the last 36 available. The tension surrounding Sunderland's visit on Wednesday did not stop a seventh consecutive win and memories of December's 5-0 thrashing of Tottenham, Liverpool's biggest ever win at White Hart Lane, offer assurance. Spurs have taken one point from seven games against the current top four this season, conceding 23 goals, and have won once in their last 19 league visits to Anfield.

38	Aston Villa	Fulham	1	2	05/04/2014	14	Fulham have not won at Villa Park in the Premier League but if they are to cling on to any chance of remaining at the top table next season they need that to change against an Aston Villa minus Christian Benteke, who ruptured an achilles tendon in training on Thursday to ruin his World Cup plans. Paul Lambert's team are unpredictable but with safety almost assured, expect them to score despite being without their main marksman against the league's most porous defence.

39	Chelsea	Stoke City	3	0	05/04/2014	14	Chelsea cannot afford to dwell on either their midweek defeat in Paris, or for that matter their loss at Crystal Palace seven days ago. A team that looked strong for so long are suddenly faltering on all fronts but this match offers José Mourinho's men a chance to at least re-establish themselves in the Premier League. Worryingly for the home side, they face a Stoke side in good form. Sachin Nakrani	1	0.002399742603302002,0.9997184872627258
40	Hull City	Swansea City	1	0	05/04/2014	14	Swansea currently shade Hull on goal difference after beating Norwich last time out but with both hovering seven points above the danger zone, a win for either should be enough to secure safety. Yet with the excitement building in advance of next weekend's FA Cup semi-final with Sheffield United expect Steve Bruce's starting XI to go all out to impress and secure their place at Wembley.

41	Manchester City	Southampton	4	1	05/04/2014	14	City remain favourites to win the title but Southampton should provide more of a challenge than the average visitor to the Etihad this season. Still, three points here would put Manuel Pellegrini's team a point behind Liverpool with the top two set to collide next weekend. Playing in the early kick-off also gives City the opportunity to put a little more pressure on Liverpool and Chelsea with a 14th home win in 15 games.

42	Newcastle United	Manchester United	0	4	05/04/2014	14	There was a time when this fixture involved two teams challenging for the title but on Saturday it is all about two managers under considerable scrutiny. While Alan Pardew – who admits he is struggling to motivate Newcastle's players – aims to compensate for last week's disappointing defeat at Southampton, David Moyes must balance the desire for points against potential European glory. With injuries depriving Pardew of several key individuals including Loïc Rémy, it will be interesting to see who he rests ahead of the Manchester United's decisive Champions League trip to Bayern Munich.

43	Norwich City	West Brom	0	1	05/04/2014	14	Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal: Norwich's run-in is unenviable, making this and next week's trip to Fulham hugely important. Six points clear of the drop, a win over an increasingly desperate West Brom would put them in a good position. Norwich's home form is strong, with an unbeaten run stretching back to December, while West Brom's only win under Pepe Mel came on the road. Defeat for Albion will increase their fears.

44	Everton	Arsenal	3	0	06/04/2014	14	Everton's fate is in their hands. Victory over Arsenal would move the Blues, who have won their past five league matches, a point behind them with a game in hand and a top-four finish would be within touching distance. Arsenal have faltered in big matches and will need to defend far better than they did in their previous away match, when they were trounced 6-0 by Chelsea. The scars from that defeat are yet to heal and Everton sense this is their time. Jacob Steinberg	1	-0.7582508325576782,0.004137486219406128
45	West Ham United	Liverpool	1	2	06/04/2014	14	Liverpool are yet to show signs of choking in their charge for the title but West Ham have the potential to make life awkward for them. Upton Park has been a graveyard for potential champions in the past and for Liverpool the fear must be that they will come unstuck at the hands of two of their former players, Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing. West Ham's defence, which has kept 13 clean sheets this season, poses another problem - but Brendan Rodgers has Luis Suárez. Jacob Steinberg	-1	-0.8952601552009583,-0.16681131720542908
46	Tottenham Hotspur	Sunderland	5	1	07/04/2014	14	Tottenham will be looking to recover from their devastating defeat to Liverpool against a Sunderland side who have struggled for goals recently. Tim Sherwood may call up the Brazilian Paulinho, who is desperate to stake his place in the Spurs team in preparation for the World Cup. Sunderland need to gather points quickly if they are to escape relegation but they do possess two games in hand. Karl Cryer	1	0.044848233461380005,-0.8470954895019531
47	Crystal Palace	Aston Villa	1	0	12/04/2014	14	After two successive 3-0 victories, Crystal Palace could virtually assure their Premier League status by completing the double over Villa. Things are rarely that simple at Selhurst Park, however, and Tony Pulis will be wary of underestimating opponents lacking their leading scorer Christian Benteke but who have picked up more points away from home than any side in the bottom half.

48	Fulham	Norwich City	1	0	12/04/2014	14	"Who could have predicted at the start of the season that with five games remaining Felix Magath and Neil Adams would be in charge of Fulham and Norwich respectively? Yet here they are, preparing for a crucial game in the relegation struggle. Fulham, five points behind Norwich, won at Aston Villa last week and Darren Bent is available again. Adams insists his first match in charge since Chris Hughton's departure ""is not a decider"", but with Norwich's horrendous run-in, a defeat could be devastating.

49	Stoke City	Newcastle United	1	0	12/04/2014	14	Stoke have the league's best home record outside of the top five with two defeats (to Norwich and Liverpool), so when you consider Newcastle are haemorrhaging goals - conceding 11 without scoring in their past three outings - it would be a shock to see Mark Hughes' side slip to a third loss at the Britannia. Already closing in on their best Premier League finish, a win would move Stoke to within three points of Alan Pardew's troubled team. Alan Smith	1	0.9704606533050537,0

While Everton arrive with a Champions League place almost within touching distance, Poyet concedes it will ""take a miracle"" to save Sunderland from the Championship.

51	West Brom	Tottenham Hotspur	3	3	12/04/2014	14	West Brom have still not won at home under Pepe Mel but it should also be noted that since he took over in January Manchester United are the only team to have won at the Hawthorns, with Everton, Liverpool and Chelsea managing only draws. Five points above the relegation zone, a first home win over an unpredictable Tottenham would go a long way to ensuring their safety. Alan Smith	0	-0.9784140586853027,0.9983190894126892
52	Liverpool	Manchester City	3	2	13/04/2014	14	Five more wins will see Liverpool crowned champions of England for the 19th time and for the first time since 1990. Easy to write, harder to accomplish. The visit of Manchester City presents arguably the toughest assignment left for Brendan Rodgers' side, although Chelsea also await, and victory at a seething Anfield would leave Manuel Pellegrini's side requiring a slip-up. City, however, with Sergio Agüero fit again, can wrestle control of the title should they inflict a first home defeat on Liverpool since September.

A draw in the earlier game at Anfield would suit José Mourinho's team but a win for City would allow Chelsea to go top with three points against a Swansea side who are still fighting to confirm their top-flight status.

54	Aston Villa	Southampton	0	0	19/04/2014	14	Aston Villa badly need to end a damaging week with the victory that would put their relegation fears to bed. The club's decision to suspend Ian Culverhouse, the assistant manager, and Gary Karsa, the head of football operations, on the back of a fourth successive defeat has left them in a state of turmoil. It is 13 years since Villa lost five league games on the spin. The visitors are also struggling, having lost three of their last four. Something has to give.

55	Chelsea	Sunderland	1	2	19/04/2014	14	Manchester City's midweek toils against the division's bottom club should serve as a warning to Chelsea, who aspire to reclaim leadership of the division for one night at least with an onerous fixture list ahead. José Mourinho will balance his selection with the Champions League semi-finals to come and next weekend's trip to Liverpool stretching his squad's resources. Sunderland must seek to repeat their resounding 3-0 success of November 2010 in these parts, but they did eliminate a strong Chelsea team from the League Cup in December.

56	Newcastle United	Swansea City	1	2	19/04/2014	14	Two tense dressing rooms, two managers contemplating uncertain futures. If the St James' Park crowd would probably not forgive Alan Pardew for a fifth straight defeat, Swansea seem to have forgotten that their mantra is supposed to be all about passing to each other rather than infighting. If Garry Monk's side can retain possession for prolonged periods Newcastle fans are likely to be turn edgy so Pardew may persist with a back five and must pray the returning France striker Loïc Rémy can alter the narrative.

57	Tottenham Hotspur	Fulham	3	1	19/04/2014	14	Fulham won this fixture last season and what they would not give for the same again. The scrutiny that has been placed on the run-in has long since reached head-wrecking levels and, realistically, Fulham know that they need to win at home to Hull and Crystal Palace. But something here, against a team that seemingly cannot start matches properly, would be a delicious tonic in the battle to prolong their 13-year association with the Premier League.

Everton are still smarting from the midweek home loss to Palace and looking for a first double over United since 1969-70. Mark Tallentire	1	0.9993380904197693,0.9989307522773743
60	Hull City	Arsenal	0	3	20/04/2014	14	After last weekend's Wembley exertions, this game is now an FA Cup final rehearsal, although both sides have some unfinished business to attend to before they can start thinking about 17 May. Hull need another win to kill off any lingering relegation fears while Arsène Wenger, having seen fourth place rapidly reclaimed from Everton in midweek, will very much want to stay there.

61	Norwich City	Liverpool	2	3	20/04/2014	14	This match is the calm between the storms for Liverpool coming as it does after the win against Manchester City and before the visit of Chelsea, yet it is equally important for Brendan Rodgers' title-chasing side. Luis Suárez will relish the occasion given he has scored 11 times in his past four games against Norwich, who will be managed at home for the first time by Neil Adams.

62	Manchester City	West Brom	3	1	21/04/2014	14	By the time West Brom arrive at the Etihad Stadium on Monday evening, Manchester City will hope that both Sunderland and Norwich City have done them a big favour by defeating their title rivals, Chelsea and Liverpool. This is how desperate and how far Manuel Pellegrini's band of multi-millionaires have fallen: looking to the Premier League's bottom and 17th-placed teams to get them back in the race following the dismal draw with Sunderland on Wednesday.

63	Fulham	Hull City	2	2	26/04/2014	14	Despite last Saturday's untimely defeat at Tottenham, Fulham's relegation escape plan will stay on track if they can triumph in what looks like an eminently winnable home game. Hull are not safe yet but are limping to the line even with FA Cup final places to play for. Felix Magath will hope Scott Parker shakes off a hip problem as his side aim to climb out of the bottom three. Paul Chronnell	0	0.03362920880317688,-0.9994180202484131

65	Southampton	Everton	2	0	26/04/2014	14	Everton's Champions League dream remains alive after last week's victory over Manchester United. They are a point behind fourth-placed Arsenal but they cannot afford a slip-up against Southampton, who will be encouraged by the news that Roberto Martinez's side will be without their first-choice centre-backs, Sylvain Distin and Phil Jagielka, through injury; Rickie Lambert will hope to capitalise on any unfamiliarity between Antolín Alcaraz and John Stones. However Southampton have injury problems of their own and are without a victory in their past three matches. Jacob Steinberg	1	-0.14467331767082214,0.9994317889213562
66	Stoke City	Tottenham Hotspur	0	1	26/04/2014	14	Despite taking seven points from their past three games, Tottenham are highly unlikely to have a chance of securing fourth place. A victory for Stoke will give them a first of five successive Premier League home wins, a record that the club and the manager, Mark Hughes, wholly deserve. A win will also virtually guarantee their place in the top 10 to cap a fine first season for the Welshman. Charlotte Trundley	-1	0.9997799694538116,-0.005888998508453369
67	Swansea City	Aston Villa	4	1	26/04/2014	14	Still without a win in five games, Villa's top-10 position just over a month ago is a distant memory. Only two wins better than bottom-placed Sunderland and without an away triumph since New Year's Day, Paul Lambert's team face a tough job against a Swansea side boosted by last Saturday's win at Newcastle. Their interim manager, Garry Monk, needs consistency in these final matches if he is to have any chance of the permanent position. Charlotte Trundley	1	-0.9896826446056366,-0.9985799789428711
68	West Brom	West Ham United	1	0	26/04/2014	14	Their first meeting this season was memorable, not for the quality of football but for Nicolas Anelka's controversial quenelle gesture. West Brom are looking pretty desperate, teetering on the edge of the drop zone, and their manager, Pepe Mel, has pinpointed this game as the one where three points must be taken. As West Ham are without a win in three games, it does seem the moment for Albion to ease their relegation fears. Charlotte Trundley	1	-0.0035194456577301025,0.9935401082038879
69	Crystal Palace	Manchester City	0	2	27/04/2014	14	This has taken on the appearance of an awkward hurdle in Manchester City's pursuit of the Premier League title. Their hosts have won five top-flight games in succession for the first time in 22 years, their safety assured and the manager, Tony Pulis, now urging his team on to a top-half finish. City, without David Silva and Jesús Navas, will be grateful for Yaya Touré's potential return in midfield as they seek to prolong the title race. Come kick-off, when the result at Anfield will be known, they will be better placed to judge their own challenge. Ship points in south London and it will feel forlorn regardless.

70	Liverpool	Chelsea	0	2	27/04/2014	14	Victory for Liverpool for the 12th successive league game would surely mean that their 24-year wait for the league title is over, but Brendan Rodgers knows that even Chelsea's supposed 'second XI' is a formidable barrier to that aim. José Mourinho will still select 11 players who are the envy of most of the Premier League, and it goes without saying he won't simply give up the title race.

71	Arsenal	Newcastle United	3	0	28/04/2014	14	Arsenal could be playing catch-up with Everton yet again by Monday evening in their pursuit of a top-four finish, though, on paper, a home collision with Newcastle is as appealing a fixture as any to fuel a rousing run-in. Alan Pardew's side have been ensconced in mid-table safety for so long that all momentum has been drained. They arrive in the capital with a squad depleted by injury and having lost their last five games, and 13 of 18 in all competitions since the end of December.

Goodison Park has brought City little reward for a decade and has witnessed only two home league defeats this season, although injuries and the ineligibility of Gareth Barry against his parent club limits Roberto Martínez's options.

There can be no lingering fallout from the damaging defeat to Chelsea, and Crystal Palace, safe in mid-table, would appear timely opposition. Yet Liverpool have not won on their last four visits to Palace, a sequence stretching back to December 1997, and the hosts will seek to end their own home campaign on a high.

That was the latter's last game in charge, the fifth of seven matches lost in succession. Yet Tony Pulis has steered the Eagles to a remarkable 11th place with the turmoil transferred to Craven Cottage. The hosts, now on their third manager of term, bid farewell to the top flight after 13 seasons with a summer of change ahead: the hope is their talented youngsters from an excellent academy are given opportunities on the final day to promise of an immediate return.

Seven months on Poyet has choreographed a miraculous escape from relegation and the Stadium of Light is preparing to party.

West Ham will be without the injured Andy Carroll, out with torn ankle ligaments until November, but have been boosted by the signing of Diafra Sakho from Metz.

96	Liverpool	Southampton	2	1	17/08/2014	15	Southampton were one of only two visiting teams to win at Anfield last season but will be unrecognisable for Ronald Koeman’s first Premier League game in charge. The goalscorer in that 1-0 win, Dejan Lovren, joined the summer exodus from St Mary’s to Liverpool and is the only former Saint likely to start against his old club with Adam Lallana suffering from a knee injury and Rickie Lambert, who has scored against all his ex-teams, set for the substitutes’ bench. Andy Hunter	1	0,-0.9298540353775024
97	Newcastle United	Manchester City	0	2	17/08/2014	15	Liam Sweeney and John Alder, who lost their lives on MH17, will be remembered as City’s title defence begins. Sweeney and Alder were flying to New Zealand to follow Newcastle’s summer tour and the pre kick-off atmosphere is likely to be rather more reflective than usual. Bolstered by some exciting new signings including Remy Cabella, Alan Pardew should escape the abuse which trapped him in his dugout at the end of last season but could do with choreographing Newcastle’s first win over City since 2005.

José Mourinho refuses to pick a starting goalkeeper between Petr Cech and Thibaut Courtois. Striker Danny Ings starts for Burnley as Sam Vokes will be sidelined until next year with a knee injury.

99	Aston Villa	Newcastle United	0	0	23/08/2014	15	For Aston Villa this fixture represents an opportunity to win the opening two matches of a season for the first time since 1999. Buoyed by last Saturday’s 1-0 win at Stoke, Villa are also boosted by the availability of Carlos Sánchez and Joe Cole, both of whom could make debuts. Newcastle, however, are unbeaten in six games against Villa and did the double over them last season. Siem de Jong is set to make his first appearance and Facundo Ferreyra, on loan from Shakhtar Donetsk, could also feature. Stuart James	0	0.993628978729248,0.9994767308235168
100	Chelsea	Leicester City	2	0	23/08/2014	15	José Mourinho may have said it is “difficult” playing newly promoted sides early in the season but his team had few problems overcoming Burnley at Turf Moor on Monday night. Nigel Pearson will be hoping that his Leicester side – beaten only four times away from home in the league last season – can present more of a challenge at Stamford Bridge this afternoon, otherwise it could be another easy three points for Chelsea.

101	Crystal Palace	West Ham United	1	3	23/08/2014	15	Crystal Palace will be relieved to get back on the pitch after another week of turmoil. They have not been able to find a replacement for Tony Pulis, their sporting director has left, and Keith Millen will be in caretaker charge again. Yet this is a good opportunity for Palace to secure their first win. They were solid at Selhurst Park last season and did the double over West Ham, who are under pressure after last week’s defeat to Tottenham. Sam Allardyce needs a result. Jacob Steinberg	-1	0.011272658904393515,0
102	Everton	Arsenal	2	2	23/08/2014	15	Arsène Wenger has his World Cup winners back for the visit to Goodison Park and the availability of Mesut Özil, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski is timely following a taxing Champions League trip to Istanbul in midweek and the loss of Mikel Arteta to an ankle injury. Arsenal were outplayed and Wenger outthought in a 3-0 defeat at Everton in April, with Romelu Lukaku starring for Roberto Martínez’s side. Goodison will be keen for a repeat from the £28m striker after a subdued opening game at Leicester City. Andy Hunter	0	0.9971199035644531,0.9666260182857513
103	Southampton	West Brom	0	0	23/08/2014	15	West Brom’s record signing, Brown Ideye, may make his debut in a refreshed strike force that will look to improve on the club’s poor goal tally last season. Georgios Samaras, however, will not be available in time for kick-off. Ronald Koeman, who is also dealing with a much changed forward lineup, will want Southampton to build on their solid but fruitless opening display against Liverpool.

104	Swansea City	Burnley	1	0	23/08/2014	15	Swansea City will be looking to maintain their winning streak against Burnley after defeating Manchester United. Swansea’s confidence is reflected by their choice to stick with last week’s winning line-up. Burnley also name an unchanged line-up in their search for their first points of the season. New Swansea signing Federico Fernández is still waiting for international clearance and is unlikely to make his debut. Graham Searles	1	0.3303401470184326,0.9797590970993042
105	Hull City	Stoke City	1	1	24/08/2014	15	The reality of competing on two fronts may hit home for Steve Bruce on Sunday. The Hull manager is expected to make changes to the side that lost 1-0 at Lokeren on Thursday but with Yannick Sagbo banned and Robert Snodgrass injured, he may be stretching his already small squad to the limit. Stoke, conversely, are fully rested and almost no injury concerns – it could be a good day at the KC Stadium for Mark Hughes. Rich Flower	0	0.32858649889628094,0.9961391091346741
106	Sunderland	Manchester United	1	1	24/08/2014	15	As Louis van Gaal seeks his first league win with Manchester United, Sunderland aim to inflict further misery on the club. Not content with defeating David Moyes’s side in last season’s Capital One Cup semi-final, Gus Poyet’s players upset Ryan Giggs’s caretakership with a springtime league win at Old Trafford. Even so, Vito Mannone, the home goalkeeper, admits he will be “more happy” if his one time Arsenal team-mate Robin van Persie does not start in attack for the visitors.

107	Tottenham Hotspur	Queens Park Rangers	4	0	24/08/2014	15	Harry Redknapp makes his first return to White Hart Lane, where he hoisted Tottenham Hotspur from the relegation zone to regular Champions League contenders during almost four years in north London, since his acrimonious divorce from Daniel Levy. His former player Danny Rose has led the calls for the 67-year-old to be granted “a good reception”, though QPR will hope Spurs are sluggish after their Europa League qualifying exploits in Cyprus on Thursday. It is 20 years since Rangers last triumphed across the capital at Spurs. Their new signings, Mauricio Isla and Leroy Fer, should feature. Dominic Fifield	1	0.9788284301757812,0.9983705878257751
108	Manchester City	Liverpool	3	1	25/08/2014	15	This is only the second match of the season yet there is the potential double reward of a title rival being defeated plus crucial momentum achieved. As the deal for Mario Balotelli was not done in time for the forward to be available for Liverpool, Manchester City must surely fancy their chances of finishing Monday evening with all three points, especially as only Alvaro Negredo and Eliaquim Mangala are unavailable to Manuel Pellegrini. Jamie Jackson	1	0.9931679368019104,0
109	Burnley	Manchester United	0	0	30/08/2014	15	The order of the day for Manchester United is simple: win. After dropping five of the first six points on offer and being beaten 4-0 by MK Dons in the Capital One Cup, the Louis van Gaal’s team are yet enjoy to victory. Three points at Turf Moor would correct this and help rebuild “smashed” confidence yet Burnley have happy memories of winning the corresponding match the last time they were in the Premier League. If Ángel di María features, the tight compact ground will provide a memorable backdrop to the debut of British football’s most expensive player. Jamie Jackson	0	0.9982424974441528,0.9996313750743866
110	Everton	Chelsea	3	6	30/08/2014	15	Roberto Martínez claimed his first league win as Everton manager against Chelsea, the victory arriving in the second home game of last season following three draws. After two draws so far, both a consequence of conceding late goals, he will be hoping for a repeat with the ex-Chelsea strikers Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto’o in his ranks but this is a far more potent and creative José Mourinho side than the one that arrived at Goodison Park for Eto’o’s debut 12 months ago. Andy Hunter	-1	0.9992267191410065,0
111	Manchester City	Stoke City	0	1	30/08/2014	15	Manchester City have denied rumours of an injury in training to Sergio Agüero but the striker will probably not be in the starting lineup. Even if Agüero is not fully fit, Manuel Pellegrini can still call upon Stevan Jovetic, scorer of two goals against Liverpool on Monday, and Edin Dzeko. Stoke also have strength in depth and Victor Moses, signed by Mark Hughes on loan from Chelsea this week, is expected to be on the bench. Rich Flower	-1	-0.0036561191082000732,0.9987038373947144
112	Newcastle United	Crystal Palace	3	3	30/08/2014	15	Neil Warnock returns to the technical area as Crystal Palace manager for a game Alan Pardew could really do with winning if Newcastle fans are to continue to offer him the benefit of the doubt. Much improved in midfield – where all eyes will be on Jack Colback in the wake of his England call-up – the home side still look lightweight in attack and await their first league goal of the season. Meanwhile Pardew, once a Palace midfielder, has promised to refrain from engagement in touchline disputes with his feisty counterpart. Louise Taylor	0	0,0.8329896728197733
113	Queens Park Rangers	Sunderland	1	0	30/08/2014	15	QPR may find themselves short of wing-backs for their 3-5-2 as Danny Simpson and Armand Traoré are thought to be negotiating moves away from Loftus Road and Jack Robinson, recently signed from Liverpool, has been loaned to Huddersfield. Harry Redknapp could have Charlie Austin available again after a thigh injury but his struggling side will be facing a fully fit Sunderland squad. Rich Flower	1	-0.9879240393638611,0.9327397346496582
114	Swansea City	West Brom	3	0	30/08/2014	15	Swansea are expected to field their new recruit, Federico Fernández, from the outset and he will be tasked with containing West Brom’s record signing, Brown Ideye, although he will be spared having to face Georgios Samaras as well – the Greece striker is still lacking match fitness. Albion will be hoping to improve on their record of four defeats in six Premier League games against Swansea. Rich Flower	1	-0.9979580640792847,0.01219072937965393
115	West Ham United	Southampton	1	3	30/08/2014	15	For Sam Allardyce the international break cannot come soon enough – West Ham have five players out injured and another, Diafra Sakho, doubtful with a back problem. Several of them are expected to return when the top flight reconvenes on 13 September but for now the West Ham manager will have to make the best of what he has against Southampton. The visitors are missing Jay Rodriguez but most of the rest of their new-look squad are available. Rich Flower	-1	-0.9950786828994751,0.05331522226333618
116	Aston Villa	Hull City	2	1	31/08/2014	15	After picking up four points from their opening two games, it has been a few days to forget for Aston Villa and Hull. Villa were defeated by lower-league opponents yet again, when they lost to Leyton Orient in the Capital One Cup, while Hull’s European campaign came to an abrupt end after losing on away goals. Villa badly need some firepower, after registering only one shot on goal in the league so far. As for Hull, Michael Dawson, newly signed from Tottenham, should make his debut.

117	Leicester City	Arsenal	1	1	31/08/2014	15	A game that evokes memories of Dennis Bergkamp’s wonderful hat-trick in the thrilling 3-3 draw under the floodlights at Filbert Street back in 1997. How Arsène Wenger must wish that he could call on the Dutchman now. With Olivier Giroud facing a long period out, Wenger’s belief that Arsenal are not light up front will come under scrutiny on an afternoon when Esteban Cambiasso could make his debut for Leicester. The Foxes have not beaten Arsenal in the Premier League since 1994. Stuart James	0	0.9489765167236328,-0.3311609427134196
118	Tottenham Hotspur	Liverpool	0	3	31/08/2014	15	This fixture demonstrated the gulf between Tottenham Hotspur, under André Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood, and those in the top four last season. Liverpool ran riot at White Hart Lane with Luis Suárez irrepressible, and then blitzed them in the return to the tune of a 9-0 aggregate scoreline. Mauricio Pochettino’s Spurs, with a perfect record to date under the Argentinian, will provide a sterner test and, if they click into their upbeat rhythm, could leave Liverpool’s start to the campaign feeling stodgy. The visitors, with Mario Balotelli in their ranks, will seek to reimpose their quality after losing at Manchester City on Monday. Dominic Fifield	-1	0.004414349794387817,-0.005623996257781982
119	Arsenal	Manchester City	2	2	13/09/2014	15	Arsenal coasted to victory in the Community Shield against City but this promises to be an altogether more intense occasion. For both clubs it is the precursor to big midweek Champions League ties in Germany while for City, the kicker at the end of the week is provided by the visit of Chelsea. Victory in the early kick-off would represent a tonic, particularly, one feels, for Arsenal, whose record against top-four finishers in the last few seasons has been poor. David Hytner	0	-0.003141343593597412,0.993177592754364
120	Chelsea	Swansea City	4	2	13/09/2014	15	Something has to give. The only teams with perfect Premier League records go head to head at Stamford Bridge and points will be shed for the first time. Chelsea may still prefer to rest Diego Costa, the division's player of the month, with one eye on a suspect hamstring and the other on Wednesday's visit of Schalke. The Welsh club, under the elite's manager of the month, have not won a league game in this corner of south-west London since 1925, though they will be sustained by the League Cup semi-final first leg win here in 2013. Such is their current confidence, they will be convinced they are capable of a repeat. Dominic Fifield	1	-0.8604419827461243,0.9913261532783508
121	Crystal Palace	Burnley	0	0	13/09/2014	15	After the uncertainty caused by Tony Pulis's departure, Crystal Palace finally have some stability now that Neil Warnock has been appointed as their manager for the second time. Warnock, who will need no introduction to the Selhurst Park crowd, will hope that Palace have a spring in their step after their dramatic draw against Newcastle United, but they are still seeking their first win of the season. However Burnley, who secured a creditable draw against Manchester United in their last match, will not roll over. Jacob Steinberg	0	0.9972744584083557,-0.9667083621025085
122	Liverpool	Aston Villa	0	1	13/09/2014	15	Something about Anfield sparks the best in Paul Lambert's Aston Villa, who were 2-0 up last season and on course to repeat the previous year’s 3-1 win until Daniel Sturridge changed the game on the stroke of half-time. Sturridge will be missing against the unbeaten Villa because of injury suffered with England but that leaves centre stage clear for Mario Balotelli on his home debut. Adam Lallana and Lazar Markovic are also pressing for inclusion as Liverpool look to build on their impressive dismantling of Spurs last time out.Andy Hunter	-1	0.9969260096549988,0.9974661767482758
123	Southampton	Newcastle United	4	0	13/09/2014	15	Southampton face winless Newcastle who let slip a commanding lead against Crystal Palace in the final seconds at St James' Park two weeks ago. Conversely Ronald Koeman's Saints picked up their first win of the campaign and will look to build further on an emphatic away win against West Ham. Morgan Schneiderlin scored twice and Koeman will definitely be looking for more of the same from the Frenchman. Graham Searles	1	0.16915327310562134,0
124	Stoke City	Leicester City	0	1	13/09/2014	15	Stoke will be still be riding high after completing a shock away victory against Manchester City last time out. They will be doubly buoyed by the fact they are unbeaten against Leicester in their last five meetings at the Britannia Stadium. Nigel Person's Leicester are still searching for a win this season but strong showings against Everton and Arsenal this season mean it should come soon for the Foxes.

125	Sunderland	Tottenham Hotspur	2	2	13/09/2014	15	As a former player and assistant manager at White Hart Lane, Gus Poyet would enjoy overcoming his old club on an afternoon when his defensive midfielder Lee Cattermole will want to show why he merits an England call-up. Italy's Emmanuel Giaccherini is similarly anxious to emphasise that he is no longer Sunderland's forgotten man but Mauricio Pochettino will look to outwit a fellow South American manager en route to seeing his Tottenham team atone for their 3-0 home defeat to Liverpool a fortnight ago.

126	West Brom	Everton	0	2	13/09/2014	15	Everton and West Brom's form is identical so far this season but Roberto Martínez will be confident as his side have scored freely in their opening games. Alan Irvine will also be spurred on by Everton's crippling defensive frailties that have led the side to concede ten goals in their opening three games. Romelu Lukaku will feel at home at the ground where he had a successful time on loan two seasons ago and will look to use this to power Everton to their first win this season.

And will he change the 3-5-2 shape that has been so sluggish and unconvincing? These are the pressing issues for the Dutchman as a Queens Park Rangers containing Rio Ferdinand roll into an Old Trafford that has become the Theatre of Nightmares rather than its more famous moniker.This could be the start of a star-studded United era as Radamel Falcao, Angel Di Maria, Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata all vie for a starting berth in Van Gaal’s XI.

128	Hull City	West Ham United	2	2	15/09/2014	15	Hull City have an improved attacking lineup after signing Hatem Ben Arfa, who starts, on loan and Abel Hernández for a club record fee of £10 million. Steve Bruce will be looking to repeat his side's 1-0 home victory last season over West Ham who also start a new loan signing in Alex Song.

129	Aston Villa	Arsenal	0	3	20/09/2014	15	Aston Villa have started strongly with 10 points from 12 and a victory at Anfield. They sit in second behind Chelsea and despite having registered only six shots on target will fancy their chances of causing another upset. They have kept a clean sheet in three of their four games to date – the same cannot be said for Arsenal who have conceded a headed goal in all four games and may also be suffering from a Champions League hangover coming into this.

Home fans are expected to demand their manager’s head but Pardew – who accuses his detractors of “mass hysteria” – has resolved to stand firm. Despite his loan from Newcastle dictating he cannot play here, Hatem Ben Arfa will be in the away dugout with his presence promising to add spice to a match Bruce may regard as an audition.

132	Queens Park Rangers	Stoke City	2	2	20/09/2014	15	Mark Hughes returns to Loftus Road for the first time since being sacked by QPR nearly two years ago and will be eager for his Stoke side to play to their impressive potential following an inconsistent start to the season. QPR, meanwhile, need to recover from last week’s drubbing at Manchester United and show signs that they really are much better off than when Hughes was in charge of them.

Southampton won both games last season to nil and will be looking to win three games on the spin for only the third time since returning to the top flight. Swansea have the most settled side in the league – Garry Monk has used only 16 players – but will need Gylfi Sigurdsson, who has four assists already to his name, to be on form if they are to maintain their 100% home record.

The Everton manager named an unchanged side for Thursday’s defeat of Wolfsburg but with Samuel Eto’o impressing as a substitute, Darron Gibson fit again plus difficult trips to Swansea City and Liverpool to come next week, he may not opt for tried-and-trusted again.

Paul Lambert’s squad had been affected by a virus before that first loss of the season and his players will arrive recovered, though competing with Chelsea, with Diego Costa fit and starting, will provide its own problems. The leaders have lost one league game at home to Villa in 12 years. They will be confident of remaining clear of the pack. Dominic Fifield	1	-0.9698492288589478,0.28617862860361737

An open, error-prone opponent is just what Liverpool need as they look to rediscover last season’s form but much will depend on Daniel Sturridge’s fitness and Raheem Sterling’s energy levels after his 120-minute outing against Middlesbrough on Tuesday.

143	Manchester United	West Ham United	2	1	27/09/2014	15	Louis van Gaal may be having nightmares about numbers as wherever he seeks refuge there are figures to frighten the very best of managers. Five points from five games, two defeats and only one win is the count from Manchester United’s dismal start. Nine is the tally of players injured with a 10th, Tyler Blackett, suspended. And 3-1 was the scoreline when West Ham dismantled Liverpool last time out. Not for the first time – and probably not the last – this term, Van Gaal and his band need a victory desperately so the number three can again be enjoyed.

144	Southampton	Queens Park Rangers	2	1	27/09/2014	15	Will the curse of the second-placed team strike again? Swansea and Aston Villa have been there this season and then blinked in the headlights. Southampton, however, will fancy their chances of staying close to Chelsea. Ronald Koeman’s side won at Arsenal in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday and have conceded only three league goals while QPR have not scored away from home this season.

145	Sunderland	Swansea City	0	0	27/09/2014	15	With Sunderland drawing four of their first five league games, supporters are underwhelmed and their manager is desperate for a win. “I need the big, big players to stand up, the ones who cost a lot of money,” said Gus Poyet, hinting he could drop the former Manchester City pair Adam Johnson and Jack Rodwell. “It’s close to a moment when I’m going to have to make a bit stronger decisions.” The former Sunderland loanee Ki Sung-yueng aims to impress for a promising Swansea side bolstered by Wilfried Bony’s return.

146	West Brom	Burnley	4	0	28/09/2014	15	When Scott Arfield gave Burnley the lead against Chelsea 14 minutes into their top-flight return the Turf Moor faithful must have wondered what all the fuss was about – 616 scoreless minutes since have reminded them. Last Sunday’s 1-0 win at Tottenham lifted Albion but they have only three league goals so far. Burnley’s last three games have ended 0-0; the odds on another will not be generous.

147	Stoke City	Newcastle United	1	0	29/09/2014	15	Alan Pardew will be hoping that the extra recovery time afforded by a Monday night fixture will aid his sickly trio of Papiss Cissé, Yoan Gouffran and Tim Krul. Cissé’s two goals against Hull last Saturday may have saved the Newcastle manager’s job – at least for now – but Pardew might have been under a lot less pressure if the Senegal striker had contributed more than 21 minutes of playing time so far this season. Stoke, usually so solid at the Britannia Stadium, have lost both their home league games and could be vulnerable. Rich Flower	1	-0.9977859258651733,-0.9826559722423553
148	Aston Villa	Manchester City	0	2	04/10/2014	15	Aston Villa’s momentum has been checked by consecutive 3-0 defeats by Arsenal and Chelsea but they may feel this is a good time to play Manchester City. Paul Lambert’s side won this fixture last season and they will hope that the champions are feeling sore after the disappointment of their 1-1 draw with Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday. But Manuel Pellegrini will back his forwards to produce the goods. Jacob Steinberg	-1	0.004461169242858887,0.8081254959106445
149	Hull City	Crystal Palace	2	0	04/10/2014	15	Neil Warnock’s Crystal Palace are still unbeaten this season under his management and have been steadily improving by winning their last two Premier League games. Warnock will be keen to continue this run of form by repeating last season’s away win. Steve Bruce’s Hull have not struggled to score goals but he will want better defensive performances from the Tigers to secure a first win at the KC Stadium this campaign.

150	Leicester City	Burnley	2	2	04/10/2014	15	Leicester aim to take advantage of fellow newcomers Burnley, who have found it very difficult in the opening stages of their return to the Premier League. Nigel Pearson will hope that their in-form new striker Ulloa can again provide the difference as he has done so often this season. Burnley, however, are desperate for goals and will need to bag a couple to get a result against free-scoring Leicester. Graham Searles	0	0.9988207221031189,-0.9933761954307556
151	Liverpool	West Brom	2	1	04/10/2014	15	Brendan Rodgers made some disparaging remarks about Mario Balotelli’s recent performances after losing away to Basel in midweek in the Champions League. Maybe the Liverpool boss will regret not picking up Danny Welbeck instead. However if Balotelli turns around Liverpool’s recent run of poor form by spearheading a first league win in four games against an improving West Brom side then, you can be sure, Rodgers and Liverpool fans will be smiling again.

152	Sunderland	Stoke City	3	1	04/10/2014	15	While attention focuses on Alan Pardew’s travails up the road at Newcastle it has almost gone unnoticed that Sunderland, too, have still to win a league game this season. This leaves Gus Poyet’s side doubly anxious to atone for Stoke’s recent 2-1 League Cup win on Wearside but whatever happens Mark Hughes is likely to cast covetous glances at Lee Cattermole. Poyet says persuading his board not to sell Sunderland’s enforcer to Stoke last January ranks as his best piece of transfer business. Louise Taylor	1	-0.3100015918413798,0
153	Swansea City	Newcastle United	2	2	04/10/2014	15	Considering the turmoil surrounding Newcastle United it is difficult to look past a solid Swansea side who will aim to capitalise on their opponents’ complete lack of confidence.

154	Chelsea	Arsenal	2	0	05/10/2014	15	The focus will be drawn to Cesc Fàbregas as he confronts his former club for the first time since returning to the Premier League, but the onus is on Arsenal to make a positive impression at Stamford Bridge. This team were thrashed 6-0 in the corresponding fixture back in March in the manager’s 1,000th game in charge, and Arsène Wenger has yet to defeat a José Mourinho side in 11 previous meetings. This is a contest between the division’s two remaining unbeaten teams: it would be a timely occasion for Wenger to break that duck. Dominic Fifield	1	0,0.9944368203481039
155	Manchester United	Everton	2	1	05/10/2014	15	Louis van Gaal is looking to end Sunday’s visit of Everton with the first consecutive league wins of his Manchester United tenure. Wayne Rooney misses the outing as the opening match of his three-game suspension, so Juan Mata is in line to take the captain’s No10 berth. Everton returned to these shores at 3am on Friday from their Europa League trip to Russia’s FK Krasnodar so Roberto Martínez will hope his team are not too tired after the journey.

156	Tottenham Hotspur	Southampton	1	0	05/10/2014	15	This was not supposed to happen after Mauricio Pochettino swapped Southampton for Spurs and the south coast club lost five key men in the summer. But Pochettino will welcome his former team who are sitting second in the table, five points better off than Tottenham. Moreover, they are in a tactical groove under Ronald Koeman as Pochettino battles to instil his philosophy at White Hart Lane. It could be an uncomfortable afternoon for the Argentinian.

Rangers, Redknapp admits, “need to tighten up” but, with the second worst goalscoring record in the league, they must find a few more goals too. West Ham have been something of a mixed bag thus far, but will fancy their chances of picking up a third win of the season. John Ashdown	1	0.9992768168449402,-0.0018555819988250732

Hull will be buoyed by Arsène Wenger’s woes and will want to build on their first home win of the season in their last outing. Wenger will still be confident, though, that his misfiring Gunners’ superior attacking force can secure a much needed victory. Graham Searles	0	0.0013952255249023438,0.9893398880958557

Combine that with West Ham’s uncharacteristically sloppy defending and surprisingly incisive attacking thus far this season and there should be goals. So put your money on a 0-0 draw.

160	Crystal Palace	Chelsea	1	2	18/10/2014	15	It was Chelsea’s inability to win matches of this kind last season which cost them a league title, Palace winning courtesy of a John Terry own goal back in the Spring to start a five-match winning run that took them to safety. José Mourinho will take a squad wounded by international efforts but steeled to avenge that first league loss to these local opponents in 24 years.Dominic Fifield	-1	0,0.9456623494625092
161	Everton	Aston Villa	3	0	18/10/2014	15	Aston Villa have faltered after an impressive start, suffering three straight defeats, so this could be a chance for Everton to revive their season with a win. But, if statistics are anything to go by, there are plenty of other teams that Roberto Martínez would rather face: last season’s 2-1 win was the first time that Everton have beaten Villa at Goodison Park in the top flight since March 2006.

162	Manchester City	Tottenham Hotspur	4	1	18/10/2014	15	Manuel Pellegrini insists that this year’s Spurs vintage are a different proposition following the arrival of Mauricio Pochettino as the manager but with Chelsea showing little sign of any early-season fade Manchester City really must beat the visitors to maintain pressure. Yaya Touré is in the match-day 18 and may well have to start despite Tuesday’s trip to Russia for the vital Champions League match against CSKA Moscow.

163	Newcastle United	Leicester City	1	0	18/10/2014	15	Alan Pardew’s 700th game as a manager is a “must win” fixture. With his Newcastle United side seeking their first Premier League victory of the season and the club’s owner Mike Ashley once again expected to be in attendance, Pardew cannot afford another slip in front of a potentially hostile home crowd. Nigel Pearson, who served as assistant manager at St James’ Park under Sam Allardyce, will be anxious to exploit any edginess among those wearing black and white as he seeks to extend Leicester’s promising start to Premier League life.

164	Southampton	Sunderland	8	0	18/10/2014	15	The international break interrupted encouraging runs for both those sides but the managers will be heartened that their key players have returned without injury, with even Sadio Mané in contention to start this match despite not getting back from Senegal to Southampton until Friday. With Sadio Mané, Dusan Tadic and Grazziano Pellè all in excellent form, Sunderland will be hard pressed to maintain their defensive record, which is second only to Southampton in the Premier League so far this season.

Yet Queens Park R,angers rock bottom and in dismal form, should not pose them too many problems. Liverpool have been boosted by Daniel Sturridge’s return from injury, while Raheem Sterling has a point to prove after the nonsense of the past week.

169	Southampton	Stoke City	1	0	25/10/2014	15	It would be an understatement to say that Southampton are going to struggle to better their performance last week. The 8-0 win over Sunderland was the most eye-catching result of the season so far but it is unlikely that there is going to be a repeat against Stoke City, who should provide a sturdier test for Ronald Koeman’s side. For Koeman, the challenge is to ensure his players maintain those high standards. Jacob Steinberg	1	0.003835916519165039,-0.9268728494644165

Atonement is demanded but Poyet’s team could probably have done without a visit from Arsenal at this delicate juncture. At least a mixture of injuries and Jack Wilshere’s suspension means Arsène Wenger is without nine first-teamers including Mesut Özil, Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott. That just leaves Aaron Ramsey, Santi Cazorla and one time Sunderland loanee Danny Welbeck to cope with. Louise Taylor	-1	-0.9989979863166809,-0.8872483174006144
171	Swansea City	Leicester City	2	0	25/10/2014	15	Swansea took nine points from nine in their opening three games but are now without a win in five.

That result at the Britannia aside, they have failed to score in their other three games away from home. Both sides are badly in need of a morale-boosting win.

173	West Ham United	Manchester City	2	1	25/10/2014	15	A critical and very difficult match for City, who crave a win in the early kick-off to edge closer to Chelsea before the league leaders’ game at Old Trafford. City were guilty of slipping into slackness in the second half of their Champions League clash with CSKA Moscow in midweek, and West Ham are as capable as the Russians of punishing them if they relapse. West Ham’s defence has been excellent all season but the in-form Sergio Agüero will give them their biggest test; though in Diafra Sakho and Enner Valenica, the Hammers have top strikers of their own.

Diego Costa remains a doubt and Loïc Rémy is definitely ruled out, meaning Mourinho may lead the line with André Schürrle, who returns from illness. Wayne Rooney remains suspended for United.

The long overdue first league victory of the season has, in Pardew’s words, given the club “the chance to build something” but the road ahead still looks long and arduous, and it will not be easy in the post-rabona landscape at White Hart Lane.

Insults have been traded between Harry Redknapp and Adel Taarabt via the press, and even Tony Fernandes was forced to wade in to quell the storm. It remains to be seen if Taarabt, described as three-stone overweight by his manager, will be selected here.

Burnley have scored only five goals in nine league games and they are likely to adopt a familiar defensive approach, in order to retain a puncher’s chance.

180	Liverpool	Chelsea	1	2	08/11/2014	15	Brendan Rodgers claims to be under no extra pressure against Chelsea following that team selection against Real Madrid but scrutiny of his methods will intensify without a positive result against the unbeaten Premier League leaders. He is acutely aware of that. Liverpool’s display at the Bernabéu has been subject to Malcolm Tucker-esque spin since Tuesday, but the fact remains they require a vast improvement to inflict defeat on Chelsea, themselves in need of a jolt after their levels dropped against QPR and Maribor.

Not the ideal time to be visiting the Premier League’s tightest defence then, but at least Leicester could start striker Leonardo Ulloa, who has recovered from the niggle that hampered him last week.

Arsenal travel to Wales eager to get back on track after that chastening experience against Anderlecht in midweek, when they surrendered a 3-0 lead, prompting Paul Merson to describe his former club as “tactically clueless”. With Mathieu Debuchy, Laurent Koscielny and Mikel Arteta sidelined, Swansea may fancy their chances of inflicting some more pain on Arsène Wenger and his players, especially with Wilfried Bony in form.

Both clubs ought to have strengthened more in defence and, as they lag outside the top four, the search for momentum has been held up. Arsenal have won two of the previous 18 meetings and, as the home team, their need for the win is probably greater.

191	Leicester City	Sunderland	0	0	22/11/2014	15	While not yet a relegation six-pointer, this game may have a hand in determining which of the two teams stays in the Premier League. Leicester entertain Sunderland having lost four of their past five league games in poor fashion. They will need striker Leonardo Ulloa, who has not netted since September, to regain the golden touch that saw him score freely earlier in the season. A Sunderland win will do much to boost morale in Gus Poyet’s side before fixtures against Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool. Yemi Abiade	0	-0.00490415096282959,0.9990148544311523
192	Manchester City	Swansea City	2	1	22/11/2014	15	The eight-point gap to Chelsea has the champions playing an unwanted game of catch-up in November. Swansea City arrive only three points behind Manchester City so Manuel Pellegrini, who may well be without Vincent Kompany and David Silva, will be wary of Garry Monk’s side. As Bayern Munich are at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday for a must-win Champions League encounter City will not want a confidence-sapping afternoon.

193	Newcastle United	Queens Park Rangers	1	0	22/11/2014	15	Joey Barton returns to St James’ Park with QPR as a resurgent Newcastle aim for a sixth successive win in all competitions and a fourth straight clean sheet. Much more of this and Tynesiders will soon be singing about “Walking in a Pardew Wonderland”. Even so, Harry Redknapp – who must pray he can somehow emulate his Newcastle counterpart’s extraordinary renaissance – will be heartened by the raft of injuries, primarily in defence, which deprive the home side of some key performers including Fabricio Coloccini.

194	Stoke City	Burnley	1	2	22/11/2014	15	Stoke City host a Burnley side who gained their first win of the season before the international break. Despite having to wait a little longer than they would have liked, Sean Dyche will be looking for a repeat performance as his side try to climb from the foot of the table. Mark Hughes, however, will be confident Stoke have enough quality to see off the Premier League newcomers. Graham Searles	-1	0.997468888759613,0.8976773023605347
195	Crystal Palace	Liverpool	3	1	23/11/2014	15	They have mockingly dubbed May’s nine-minute, three-goal capitulation as “Crystanbul” in south London and Liverpool will be haunted by memories of that evening upon Sunday’s return to Selhurst Park. The visitors have actually won only once at Palace in 20 years but, while their own season has been stodgy, they will confront hosts whose recent form is unrecognisable from that which propelled Tony Pulis’s team to safety last term. One point from five is a miserable return and they could be in tbe bottom three come kick-off. Liverpool will be after revenge. Dominic Fifield	1	-0.9827603995800018,0.7548944652080536
196	Hull City	Tottenham Hotspur	1	2	23/11/2014	15	Hull City will want to pick themselves up after a deserved 1-0 defeat to Burnley in their last outing, a display considerably below what manager Steve Bruce has come to expect. Not much is better at Tottenham Hotspur. After Emmanuel Adebayor’s controversial comments that the players would rather play away, failure to win at the KC Stadium will leave them with nowhere to hide from their expectant fans.

197	Aston Villa	Southampton	1	1	24/11/2014	15	Going by the form book, this should be a walk in the park for Saints. Ronald Koeman’s side have won 11 of their last 12 matches in all competitions and will arrive at Villa Park second in the table. They are full of confidence. Aston Villa, on the other hand, have picked up one point out of a possible 21 – a goalless draw at Upton Park last time out – and are without three central defenders through injury as well as the suspended Christian Benteke. Stuart James	0	-0.9761210083961487,0.045478999614715576
198	Burnley	Aston Villa	1	1	29/11/2014	15	Sean Dyche and Burnley will be feeling good as they prepare to face Aston Villa. They have won their last two matches and have moved off the bottom of the Premier League table. While Burnley have found some form, Aston Villa are without a win in eight. If Dyche masterminds a third victory then Burnley will leapfrog Aston Villa and most probably move out of the relegation zone. Graham Searles	0	-0.31448227167129517,-0.9996689558029175
199	Liverpool	Stoke City	1	0	29/11/2014	15	Steven Gerrard may be on the bench on the 16th anniversary of his Liverpool debut with Brendan Rodgers admitting prior to the Champions League draw with Ludogorets that three games in a week should not be expected of him. Whoever starts will be under pressure to deliver a first win in November for Liverpool and to respond to the manager’s demand for greater resilience. Stoke, smarting from last weekend’s home defeat by Burnley, have beaten Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur on their travels this season. Andy Hunter	1	0.9708243906497955,0.9993459582328796
200	Manchester United	Hull City	3	0	29/11/2014	15	The Louis van Gaal project continues to rumble along, convincing in fleeting moments but lacking the consistent high-gear quality of the best Manchester United teams. Perhaps after the rousing win at Arsenal that derived from counterattacking play, Van Gaal’s side will click into a team able to perform for 90 minutes against visiting Hull City who will want to improve on recent form. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.9959160685539246,0.9915154874324799
201	Queens Park Rangers	Leicester City	3	2	29/11/2014	15	QPR and Leicester City both look likely to be returning to the Championship next season on current form. It is early to call this a relegation six-point affair but Harry Redknapp and Nigel Pearson will be desperate for three points to secure leverage in the fight to stay up. QPR look early favourites as Leicester have not scored in five and are without a win in their past seven league games. Graham Searles	1	-3.606081008911133e-05,0
202	Sunderland	Chelsea	0	0	29/11/2014	15	Sunderland may appear in peril of reprising last season’s relegation skirmish but at least Gus Poyet knows how to beat José Mourinho. As a former Chelsea player, Poyet relished choreographing a 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge in April which ended Mourinho’s run of 77 undefeated home Premier League games during his two stints in charge in west London. As if that was not enough, Poyet’s players also knocked Chelsea out of last season’s League Cup. Can lightning strike thrice? “I’m hoping for an ugly evening with lots of wind and rain,” he says.

203	Swansea City	Crystal Palace	1	1	29/11/2014	15	Swansea City will be looking to get back to winning ways when they entertain Crystal Palace on Saturday at the Liberty Stadium. The Swans were far from disgraced in last week’s defeat at Manchester City and Garry Monk will certainly hope for all three points. Crystal Palace will be looking to build on their victory over Liverpool after suffering four defeats in five before last weekend’s result, although they have won just once on the road in the Premier League this season.

204	West Brom	Arsenal	0	1	29/11/2014	15	Arsenal arrive at the Hawthorns off the back of a fine 2-0 victory against Borussia Dortmund in midweek and will hope to pick up where they left off. Olivier Giroud also makes his first start since August and the prospect of the Frenchman and Alexis Sánchez linking up must be daunting for West Brom. Alan Irvine will no doubt be hoping Arsenal show their usual defensive frailties. Graham Searles	-1	0.998715877532959,0.011523574590682983
205	West Ham United	Newcastle United	1	0	29/11/2014	15	Sam Allardyce and Alan Pardew have both had their detractors but now West Ham and Newcastle are sixth and fifth in the league respectively. Life has rarely been this good and Pardew’s Newcastle will arrive at Upton Park in a confident mood after winning their past five matches. Allardyce reckons that only Chelsea would provide a bigger test at the moment, so he will be pleased to have Stewart Downing available again after he missed West Ham’s defeat at Everton last Saturday. Jacob Steinberg	1	0.9969037175178528,0.9997212290763855
206	Southampton	Manchester City	0	3	30/11/2014	15	Second hosts third in the game of catch-up with this a true test of these sides’ credentials. The visitors will hope to maintain momentum after their narrow victory against Swansea and late midweek triumph over Bayern Munich. Southampton secured a point at Aston Villa last time out but it is a mark of their progress to date this term that even a draw in the west Midlands felt wasteful. Their pedigree will be scrutinised in a tough schedule over the next month. There has been little evidence to date that they will be daunted. Dominic Fifield	-1	0.3264886240164439,0
207	Hull City	West Brom	0	0	06/12/2014	15	Despite taking points at Liverpool and Arsenal in October, Hull lost all their November games to find themselves in the relegation zone on Tuesday. Steve Bruce was relieved after a 1-1 draw with Everton lifted them to 17th but the Tigers are still without a win in seven and a point behind the visitors, West Brom, who have lost their past four putting pressure on Alan Irvine to stop the rot. His side travel to the KC Stadium without the captain, Chris Brunt, who suffered a hamstring injury in their midweek defeat to West Ham. Amy Eustace	0	-0.9990687966346741,-0.6611784100532532
208	Liverpool	Sunderland	0	0	06/12/2014	15	Brendan Rodgers was under siege a week ago; now he is seeking a hat-trick of league wins for the first time since April. A back-to-basics approach has paid dividends for the Liverpool manager, who may again consider resting Steven Gerrard with a crucial Champions League game against Basel plus Manchester United to come next week. Sunderland have scored only five goals in six league away games this season and last won at Anfield in 1983. Andy Hunter	0	0.9805422425270081,-0.9574968814849854
209	Manchester City	Everton	1	0	06/12/2014	15	Manchester City have hit good form when required and Everton are in the middle of an unwanted stumble so Manuel Pellegrini’s team will be confident of claiming three points from a fixture won home and away last season. The champions’ rousing 4-1 victory at Sunderland in the week was a third consecutive win while Everton’s 1-1 draw with Hull City meant Roberto Martinez’s side have a sole victory in their past five outings. Still, Everton arrive with Ross Barkley in their ranks, a player much admired by City. If is at his best the visitors have a chance. Jamie Jackson	1	0.9952293634414673,0.9993946750958761
210	Newcastle United	Chelsea	2	1	06/12/2014	15	José Mourinho may be the Special One but he is still to win a Premier League game at Newcastle. Even so, St James’ Park regulars have long wondered what might have been had Sir Bobby Robson got his way and succeeded in persuading the Portuguese to go there as his assistant back in the late 1990s. Mourinho and Alan Pardew are friends but Pardew would still relish celebrating Tuesday’s fourth anniversary of his installation as Newcastle manager by ending Chelsea’s unbeaten run.

211	Queens Park Rangers	Burnley	2	0	06/12/2014	15	Loftus Road is becoming a fortress for QPR, which is just as well given that they are yet to pick up a point on their travels. Harry Redknapp’s team are unbeaten in their past three home matches and they welcome another promoted side to west London after edging a thrilling encounter with Leicester City last Saturday. However Burnley, unbeaten in four matches, are starting to find their feet and they will hope that Danny Ings can inspire them again. Jacob Steinberg	1	0.013374239206314087,0.9995614886283875
212	Stoke City	Arsenal	3	2	06/12/2014	15	There has been an extra needle to clashes between these teams ever since Aaron Ramsey suffered that horrendous injury following a tackle by Ryan Shawcross in 2010. Even before that Arsenal did not relish trips to the Britannia, where Arsène Wenger has won only once in seven attempts. But this might be a good time to visit, as Stoke are struggling with both injuries and form and have lost their last three leagues games. Nothing would give Stoke fans greater pleasure that run end against Arsenal. Paul Doyle	1	-0.31087160110473633,-0.9407993853092194
213	Tottenham Hotspur	Crystal Palace	0	0	06/12/2014	15	Tottenham suffered an inevitable reality check at Chelsea on Wednesday but they will seek to use the positivity that returned to White Hart Lane in the win over Everton last weekend. Mauricio Pochettino wants to see more sustained evidence that his philosophy is taking root and he will again be without Emmanuel Adebayor, who remains weak after a virus. Crystal Palace have promised to be positive. “If you go into away games thinking a point is good, you tend to lose,” Julián Speroni said. David Hytner	0	-0.18625056743621826,0.0007103681564331055
214	Aston Villa	Leicester City	2	1	07/12/2014	15	Nigel Pearson desperately needs three points on Sunday having incurred the wrath of Foxes fans in the home defeat to Liverpool on Tuesday. His side have failed to win since beating Manchester United 5-3 in September. Villa, on the other hand, ended a run of nine games without a win at Selhurst Park on Tuesday. Their 1-0 victory came courtesy of a Christian Benteke strike and Paul Lambert will certainly hope that the forward is soon back to his old, sparkling self.

215	West Ham United	Swansea City	3	1	07/12/2014	15	Neither of these sides were considered likely contenders for the European places back in August but they kick off on Sunday in fifth and seventh places respectively and are showing few signs of strain. Both clubs acted shrewdly in the summer – there haven’t proved to be too many better bargains than Gylfi Sigurdsson and Alex Song – and will be looking to do so again next month. Paul Chronnell	1	0,-0.08363020420074463
216	Southampton	Manchester United	1	2	08/12/2014	15	Successive defeats might have given Southampton an unwelcome wake-up call had their performance at Arsenal not been so impressive. They will consider a visit from Manchester United as an opportunity to regain lost momentum, though injuries are starting to test the depth of Ronald Koeman’s squad. Louis van Gaal will have no sympathy on that front given his own list of absentees. United have won four in a row and are upwardly mobile. This test is awkward, but less daunting than it would recently have appeared. Dominic Fifield	-1	-0.336004098256429,-0.3212033112843831
217	Arsenal	Newcastle United	4	1	13/12/2014	15	Newcastle begin an important week with a visit to one of their bogey teams. They have beaten Arsenal only once in 17 meetings and Alan Pardew has lost on each of his three visits with the club to the Emirates. The 7-3 defeat in December 2012 was sobering but Newcastle are in confident mood after beating Chelsea and they want another tonic before the Capital One Cup tie at Tottenham and the derby against Sunderland next Sunday.

218	Burnley	Southampton	1	0	13/12/2014	15	Having handsomely defied predictions of a relegation struggle, Southampton’s surprise top-four residency was ended after Monday’s defeat to Manchester United, a third successive loss. They will view this game as a chance to recover but Burnley, who saw their four-game unbeaten run ended at QPR last time out, have already shown the requisite battling qualities to stay in the top flight. Paul Chronnell	1	-0.6487274765968323,-0.9794925451278687
219	Chelsea	Hull City	2	0	13/12/2014	15	José Mourinho will see this as an opportunity to restore momentum after losing at Newcastle. Petr Cech will start given the muscular injury sustained by Thibaut Courtois, though that does not suggest weakness. Hull, with one win in 14 matches, arrive fragile if perhaps marginally encouraged by the points taken off Everton and West Brom in their past two fixtures. They have never won at Chelsea. Given they will begin the game below the relegation cut-off, this would be a timely occasion to make history. Dominic Fifield	1	-0.27424971262613934,0.05290493369102478
220	Crystal Palace	Stoke City	1	1	13/12/2014	15	While Stoke fans like nothing more than cheering on their team to victory over Arsenal, as they did last weekend, it is probably fair to say their manager would get particular pleasure from putting one over Neil Warnock’s team. Warnock riled Mark Hughes by suggesting he “destroyed” QPR after succeeding him in 2012 and the pair have had a frosty relationship ever since. Paul Doyle	0	0,0.18887892365455627
221	Leicester City	Manchester City	0	1	13/12/2014	15	Leicester will be dreading the arrival of Manchester City. Nigel Pearson’s side are bottom and struggling for form. Manchester City will be confident after qualifying for the knockout stages of the Champions League. Manuel Pellegrini will need to remind his players of what happened to Manchester United earlier this season to keep their focus on the task in hand.

222	Sunderland	West Ham United	1	1	13/12/2014	15	The days when Sam Allardyce was a very traditional Sunderland centre-half are long ago. Should West Ham’s now ultra modern, European challenging manager involve Diego Poyet, the afternoon will assume an unusual feel for his father, Gus. Poyet Sr could do with three points as he strives to rebrand a Sunderland side who, although promising, remain a work in progress. Andy Carroll can expect a hot reception - but Allardyce’s former Newcastle United striker would relish scoring the winner. Louise Taylor	0	-0.04726433753967285,0.9138379096984863
223	West Brom	Aston Villa	1	0	13/12/2014	15	West Brom have failed to win in their past five matches and have disappointed supporters with lacklustre performances. Alan Irvine will surely look to the derby atmosphere against Aston Villa to stir his side into life in order to secure a much-needed victory. Villa on the other hand are improving and Christian Benteke could hold the key for Paul Lambert to upset Albion. Graham Searles	1	-0.9996625185012817,0.9990900456905365
224	Manchester United	Liverpool	3	0	14/12/2014	15	David Moyes’s branding of Liverpool as favourites against Manchester United at Old Trafford for last season’s edition of this fixture hardly enamoured the Scot to fans. In Louis van Gaal they now have a manager to believe in and he “welcomes” Brendan Rodgers’ side seeking a six consecutive win. The Liverpool manager is feeling serious heat due to average domestic form and being knocked out of the Champions League and a victory over the auld enemy would be a fair fillip. Jamie Jackson	1	0,0.33108357588450116
225	Swansea City	Tottenham Hotspur	1	2	14/12/2014	15	Swansea and Tottenham know all about the Europa League effect; last season it cost both clubs a manager and finishing where they wanted. Freed from its shackles, Swansea are eighth but need to recover from their damaging defeat at West Ham. Spurs have struggled after Thursday exertions before and the tiring Europa League trip to Turkey will have taken its toll but those excuses are wearing thin.

226	Everton	Queens Park Rangers	3	1	15/12/2014	15	Both sides are in urgent need of victory for very different reasons. Everton have not won in three league games and home form is largely responsible for Roberto Martínez’s side falling behind the European hopefuls. Goodison Park has witnessed only two league wins this term but their injury list is clearing and John Stones could return after an ankle injury. Harry Redknapp’s strugglers have lost all seven away games, the worst record in the division. Andy Hunter	1	-0.963193416595459,-0.999775230884552
227	Aston Villa	Manchester United	1	1	20/12/2014	15	Manchester United will travel to Aston Villa in high spirits having won their previous six league games.

228	Hull City	Swansea City	0	1	20/12/2014	15	Time is still on Steve Bruce and Hull City’s side but having not won in nine games the Tigers will be starting to worry. Swansea City is the perfect opportunity to gain some momentum but Garry Monk will have other ideas as the Swans also look to climb back up the table after two disappointing defeats. Hull need a spark in front of goal – what happened to new signing Abel Hernández? Graham Searles	-1	-0.9965984225273132,-0.8000839948654175
229	Manchester City	Crystal Palace	3	0	20/12/2014	15	Manuel Pellegrini has Sergio Agüero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic all injured for this visit of Crystal Palace meaning the champions of England have no frontline striker available. The manager may field José Ángel Pozo in attack for a consecutive start as he is a forward by trade, or perhaps turn to James Milner, Samir Nasri or David Silva to knit the side together when moving forward. Pellegrini, though, can be delighted at being only three points behind Chelsea following their early season travails yet Neil Warnock’s Palace may prove awkward opposition.

230	Queens Park Rangers	West Brom	3	2	20/12/2014	15	Alan Irvine will hope West Brom can use their victory in the derby last weekend as a springboard. The Baggies did not exactly blow Aston Villa away though, and Harry Redknapp will be well aware that QPR, in front of their own fans, can exploit his side. Is it to soon to call this a ‘six-pointer? Maybe, but both clubs need a victory to help spread the festive cheer. Graham Searles	1	0,0.9921360015869141
231	Southampton	Everton	3	0	20/12/2014	15	Having suffered five defeats in a row including the midweek shock at Sheffield United and with some nasty fixtures to come at the turn of the year, Southampton could really do with a win. However they are so ravaged by injury and suspension that Toby Alderweireld may start in midfield to add steel. Everton arrive five places and points below them but travel to the south coast after overcoming a winless league run of four with a 3-1 victory over QPR on Monday.

232	Tottenham Hotspur	Burnley	2	1	20/12/2014	15	This is not the most glamorous fixture on Tottenham’s calendar but in the context of their season, its importance cannot be overstated. The club fired a positive vibe at White Hart Lane with the midweek League Cup win over Newcastle, as they had done in the league victory against Everton, but on too many occasions Spurs have stumbled at home against teams that are below them in the table. Burnley have found form but Tottenham know that a win is essential. David Hytner	1	0.009918570518493652,0.9952078461647034
233	West Ham United	Leicester City	2	0	20/12/2014	15	West Ham United will be confident of continuing their outstanding form. While Sam Allardyce’s side have risen to fourth place after losing one of their past 10, the goals have dried up for Leicester, who are without a win in 11. The pressure on their manager, Nigel Pearson, is increasing and only a win at Upton Park would give Leicester a chance of not being bottom at Christmas.

234	Liverpool	Arsenal	2	2	21/12/2014	15	Brendan Rodgers finally found respite – and an effective formation – at Bournemouth but back in the Premier League it is a case of two managers needing to convince at Anfield. Arsène Wenger will shudder at the memory of his last visit, February’s 5-1 humiliation that holed his then Premier League leaders’ title credentials and reinforced Liverpool’s own in the process. Arsenal must also improve on their last away league display at Stoke City to avoid any nasty confrontations at Lime Street Station afterwards. Andy Hunter	0	-0.9949418902397156,-0.9770455658435822
235	Newcastle United	Sunderland	0	1	21/12/2014	15	Alan Pardew is desperate to avoid becoming the first Newcastle manager to lose four straight derbies to Sunderland. He could do without having his novice third-choice goalkeeper, Jak Alnwick, protecting his defence. Not to mention being up against Gus Poyet. The Uruguayan was labelled “a scourge of this club” by Sir Bobby Robson when, as a Chelsea and Spurs player, he was prone to scoring against the Tynesiders. Key subplots include the likely midfield duel between Moussa Sissoko and Sunderland’s Lee Cattermole and the performance of Newcastle’s Jack Colback against his former employers.

236	Arsenal	Queens Park Rangers	2	1	26/12/2014	15	There can be few Queens Park Rangers supporters who truly believe their side can take anything from a trip to the Emirates given they have lost all eight of their away league fixtures this season. But with Charlie Austin in excellent goalscoring form and Arsenal’s defence looking as leaky as a ripped sieve, a shock could be on the cards should the visitors show ambition from the outset.

Sean Dyche is making progress at Burnley but he will be hoping Liverpool stumble again in his quest to move out of danger. Graham Searles	-1	-0.9836159348487854,-0.9437826573848724
238	Chelsea	West Ham United	2	0	26/12/2014	15	Chelsea’s response to that first defeat of the season, at Newcastle, has been immaculate, with Monday’s success at Stoke a fourth successive win in all competitions to ensure they remain clear at the summit. West Ham, in the top four at Christmas for the first time since 1985, will provide another stern test of the hosts’ title aspirations even if it is 12 years since the Hammers last triumphed down the District Line. With Arsenal to follow on the 28th, these next two derby fixtures will offer an indication of the strengths of Sam Allardyce’s side. Dominic Fifield	1	0.9997250437736511,0.9758380651473999
239	Crystal Palace	Southampton	1	3	26/12/2014	15	After a positive start to the season Crystal Palace have stalled and are hovering dangerously above the relegation zone. Meanwhile Southampton drew a line under their run of five defeats in all competitions with an emphatic 3-0 victory over Everton last weekend. Southampton will be looking to add another victory to that to strengthen their European ambitions. Graham Searles	-1	-0.949980616569519,0.9974736571311951
240	Everton	Stoke City	0	1	26/12/2014	15	There were groans around Goodison Park over Everton’s laboured style of play even when 3-0 up against QPR last week and discontent has grown following an abject defeat by the same scoreline at Southampton. Roberto Martínez needs to find a settled, more incisive team fast and Stoke City, with only one win in their past six league games, would leapfrog Everton with a victory. Troubled times for both.

241	Leicester City	Tottenham Hotspur	1	2	26/12/2014	15	Leicester City’s troubles continue and Nigel Pearson will be feeling some pressure as his side are without a win in 12 matches. Mauricio Pochettino, however, will be feeling much better after a run of three victories in all competitions. A win would be a long overdue Christmas present for the Foxes but against high-spirited Tottenham Hotspur it could be a long shot. Graham Searles	-1	-0.9988094568252563,0.9744608402252197
242	Manchester United	Newcastle United	3	1	26/12/2014	15	So impressive has been Manchester United’s resurgence under Louis van Gaal that the draw at Aston Villa was greeted by dismay by the manager and players after six consecutive wins in the league. Newcastle United arrive having lost their past two, a resounding 4-1 defeat at Arsenal and the late 1-0 Tyne-Wear derby reverse, so their manager, Alan Pardew, is once again in need-of-a-win mode.

243	Sunderland	Hull City	1	3	26/12/2014	15	Hull City are winless in 10, there have been behind-the-scenes problems featuring Hatem Ben Arfa and Paul McShane and the Stadium of Light is probably about the last place Steve Bruce would have wanted to visit on Boxing Day. Sunderland’s former manager is unlikely to be welcomed by his less than adoring public but Gus Poyet’s team remain short of wins themselves and could do with building on last Sunday’s morale-boosting victory at Newcastle. Hulls’s Ahmed Elmohamady and David Meyler will be keen to upstage their former Sunderland team-mates. Louise Taylor	-1	-0.6699594855308533,-0.9975818395614624
244	Swansea City	Aston Villa	1	0	26/12/2014	15	Swansea City welcome back top scorer Wilfried Bony to the starting lineup and their chances of beating Aston Villa are improved by that. Conversely Aston Villa lose Gabby Agbonlahor through suspension and Paul Lambert will no doubt be worried about his growing list of absentees. On current form Swansea should prevail but it would certainly be far from a Christmas miracle if Aston Villa shocked the home support. Graham Searles	1	0.9997482895851135,-0.9896790981292725
245	West Brom	Manchester City	1	3	26/12/2014	15	West Brom face an incredibly difficult task in hosting Manchester City. Manuel Pellegrini must be elated with how his side are playing despite having a significantly depleted strike force. Alan Irvine will be buoyed by James Milner starting but with the quality Pellegrini has at his disposal in midfield this somewhat leftfield choice will probably not change the result.

246	Burnley	Queens Park Rangers	2	1	10/01/2015	15	Charlie Austin will make his first return to Turf Moor in the Premier League as a QPR player having completed the unlikely hat-trick of scoring, assisting and being sent off when Rangers were 2-0 victors over Burnley in December. The hosts’ mini-revival has seen them draw with Manchester City, Newcastle and Spurs in their past three games in all competitions, but an elusive an elusive three points is a must against relegation rivals Hoops, who lost 30 last weekend in the FA Cup to giantkillers Sheffield United. Luke Weston	1	0,0.9985833764076233
247	Chelsea	Newcastle United	2	0	10/01/2015	15	Chelsea were beaten 5-3 by Spurs on New Year’s Day and that could be bad news for Newcastle, who would be wise to prepare themselves for the backlash at Stamford Bridge. José Mourinho’s side were eight points clear of Manchester City in November, but are now top only on alphabetical order and they will be determined to quash any talk of them looking vulnerable. As for Newcastle, it is another chance for John Carver to throw his hat into the managerial ring. Jacob Steinberg	1	-0.9923143982887268,0.9648087620735168
248	Crystal Palace	Tottenham Hotspur	2	1	10/01/2015	15	Returning to league action for the first time since their exhilarating win over Chelsea, Tottenham will be confident of extending their seven-match unbeaten run but know they face a serious test in the form of a Palace side intent on embarking on a hot streak of their own under Alan Pardew. The question is a fresh approach and renewed optimism will be enough for Palace to compensate for the new manager’s chances are not helped by the absence of key duo Mile Jedinak and Yannick Bolasie, both of whom are away on international duty.

249	Everton	Manchester City	1	1	10/01/2015	15	While Manuel Pellegrini has found different ways to win in the absence of his leading strikers, Roberto Martínez continues to search for one. The champions are unbeaten in 13 matches, winning 11, and could have Sergio Agüero, Edin Dzeko and Vincent Kompany back for the trip to what promises to be a tense Goodison Park. Everton were improved in their FA Cup tie with West Ham United on Tuesday but will require another level to prevent a fifth successive Premier League defeat. Andy Hunter	0	-0.9861295819282532,0.994472324848175
250	Leicester City	Aston Villa	1	0	10/01/2015	15	Leicester will be looking to extend their unbeaten run to what would be a season’s best four games in all competitions against a goal-shy Aston Villa who are winless in five, scoring only once in that period, and a total of just 11 times in the Premier League this season. Nigel Pearson will certainly be targeting a second home win of the campaign to lift his side off the foot of the table. Luke Weston	1	0.9955234229564667,0
251	Sunderland	Liverpool	0	1	10/01/2015	15	Jordan Henderson and Simon Mignolet return to Wearside on a day when Brendan Rodgers will hope to move a little closer to the European places and Gus Poyet further away from the relegation zone. The divisional draw specialists, Sunderland are difficult to beat but have won only one of their past 10 Premier League games and are likely to be without the influential Lee Cattermole. Rodgers could do with Steven Gerrard marking what seems set to be his farewell appearance in the north-east with a reminder of his match-winning talents.

252	Swansea City	West Ham United	1	1	10/01/2015	15	Swansea begin life without top-scorer Wilfried Bony because of Africa Cup of Nations duty and with a £30m move to Manchester City beckoning. The Ivorian leaves a gaping hole in the Welsh side that most teams would find difficult to fill. All eyes turn to Bafétimbi Gomis and whether he can fill that gap. West Ham are aiming to return to winning ways after three games without a win. Yemi Abiade	0	-0.39139548937479657,-0.9874731302261353
253	West Brom	Hull City	1	0	10/01/2015	15	Tony Pulis has taken over at The Hawthorns and West Brom are safe. That is the theory among many, although Pulis, who has never been relegated in his managerial career, is keen to guard against any complacency. After the 7-0 thrashing of Gateshead in the FA Cup in his first game in charge, the serious business starts for the Welshman with the visit of a Hull side depleted through injury but buoyed by festive wins over Sunderland and Everton.A tight game with few goals is anticipated.

254	Arsenal	Stoke City	3	0	11/01/2015	15	Many Arsenal fans may be more interested in what Arsène Wenger does in the transfer market this month than this game, but the pleas for the Frenchman to sign defensive and midfield reinforcements have thus far fallen on deaf ears. December’s defeat at Stoke was arguably the low point of a difficult season at the Emirates, and Mark Hughes will aim to make life uncomfortable again. Paul Chronnell	1	-0.9982530474662781,0
255	Manchester United	Southampton	0	1	11/01/2015	15	As only one point separates Manchester United from Southampton Louis van Gaal will be keen to defeat the visitors as the race for the Champions League berths continues. This match may see the sight of Víctor Valdés on the bench for United for the first time after the former Barcelona keeper signed an 18-month deal to be David de Gea’s deputy as the club’s No2 goalkeeper. Jamie Jackson	-1	0.9952799379825592,0
256	Aston Villa	Liverpool	0	2	17/01/2015	15	Aston Villa will look like easy targets to Liverpool despite being the away side and having a significantly depleted squad. Paul Lambert’s side are without a win in six league games and have not scored in their last four. Their new signing Carles Gil could make his debut from the bench and in doing so might provide Christian Benteke with some much-needed quality service in the final third. Graham Searles	-1	-0.28850557406743366,0
257	Burnley	Crystal Palace	2	3	17/01/2015	15	Burnley and Crystal Palace have identical form for their past five league games and both find themselves hovering above the relegation zone on 20 points. Crystal Palace may feel they have the edge with Alan Pardew at the helm, but Sean Dyche will be supremely focused on producing a positive display after capitulating in the FA Cup to Tottenham in midweek.

258	Leicester City	Stoke City	0	1	17/01/2015	15	Leicester City start the weekend bottom of the Premier League, two points adrift of Hull City. Despite relegation looming large over the Foxes the mood in Leicester will have lifted recently with two wins in three and the signing of the prolific young Croatian striker, Andrej Kramaric. Stoke City were poor last time out against Arsenal and will have to improve to get a positive result. Graham Searles	-1	0.0010977089405059814,-0.9914047718048096
259	Newcastle United	Southampton	1	2	17/01/2015	15	Newcastle fly to Dubai on Sunday for a warm weather training break. John Carver - who turned 50 on Friday - will hope to board the plane celebrating his first victory since succeeding Alan Pardew in a caretaker capacity. Carver knows a win would enhance his chances of keeping the job until the end of the season but could have wished for less formidable opponents than Champions League challengers Southampton. Much may depend on the form of the returning Fraser Forster, the visiting goalkeeper and Newcastle academy graduate. Louise Taylor	-1	0.9960437218348185,0.7935538589954376
260	Queens Park Rangers	Manchester United	0	2	17/01/2015	15	Queens Park Rangers have not lost at home since October, but their past two results at Loftus Road, draws with Crystal Palace and Swansea City, have been disappointing and they have slipped back into the relegation zone. Manchester United will hope to plunge QPR into deeper trouble and will be determined to get back on track after last Sunday’s defeat against Southampton. With Robin van Persie injured, Radamel Falcao is set to return for United. Jacob Steinberg	-1	-0.9970334768295288,0.9763621687889099
261	Swansea City	Chelsea	0	5	17/01/2015	15	José Mourinho will want nothing but all three points against Swansea City. Chelsea could potentially move further ahead of title rivals Manchester City as the latter could drop points against Arsenal. While Swansea will be relying on Bafétimbi Gomis to replace the goal threat of Wilfried Bony, the Frenchman may lack the quality needed to break down Chelsea’s solid defensive line.

262	Tottenham Hotspur	Sunderland	2	1	17/01/2015	15	Jermain Defoe looks set to start against his former club Tottenham Hotspur in his first game for new employers Sunderland. The visitors will hope that Defoe continues his record of scoring on debut for every club he has played for to help produce a shock result. Spurs, however, have a new talisman in Harry Kane and no doubt will rely on the Englishman to provide the difference. Graham Searles	1	0.9937129020690918,0.9997134804725647
263	Manchester City	Arsenal	0	2	18/01/2015	15	Sergio Agüero and Alexis Sánchez, arguably the season’s best players thus far, should share the same field in a contest Manchester City will be desperate to win as their next league outing is a title showdown with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Yet Arsenal will want a say: can Arsène Wenger’s team finally beat the champions on their own patch to end a five-year drought in north Manchester?

His good friend, Steve Bruce, however, is in more desperate need. The Hull manager is enduring what he has called the worst injury crisis of his 17 years in management and, if results go against him on Saturday, his team could kick off at the bottom of the table.

265	Everton	West Brom	0	0	19/01/2015	15	Tony Pulis made a winning start to his Albion reign and will be looking to repeat last season’s success with Crystal Palace at Everton in his first away game in charge. There is no margin for error for Roberto Martínez. Everton are three points above the relegation zone, have won once in 12 games, have exited both domestic cup competitions at the opening hurdle for the first time in their history and are facing a difficult February.

266	Chelsea	Manchester City	1	1	31/01/2015	15	José Mourinho has ‘empirical evidence’ that the world is against him. His star striker’s unwitting tread on the foot of an opponent has been ‘distorted’ into a stamping storm and suspension while the Chelsea manager himself is £25,000 lighter for having had the temerity to suggest that the world is indeed against him. He might be without not only Diego Costa but Cesc Fàbregas, who has a hamstring issue, against a City side who are having a wobble. Expect more fireworks.

267	Crystal Palace	Everton	0	1	31/01/2015	15	Crystal Palace have never enjoyed a league double over Everton, and have not beaten them at Selhurst Park since an Andy Preece goal secured victory in October 1994, but this would appear their best opportunity in a generation. Alan Pardew, who had scored a winner against the Merseysiders five years earlier, has won his four games in charge to date while Roberto Martínez’s team arrive with one win in 13 to their name. Level of points at start of play, b oth will consider this an opportunity to eke breathing space from the relegation cut-off. Dominic Fifield	-1	0.9558152159055074,0
268	Hull City	Newcastle United	0	3	31/01/2015	15	Its been a poor start to 2015 for Hull City, who have failed to win since New Year’s Day. They are currently enduring a catastrophic run of injuries and Steve Bruce has openly criticised key players. Defeat to Newcastle United could send them bottom, but the away side have not won since Alan Pardew left. John Carver needs three points to quell doubts over his appointment.

269	Liverpool	West Ham United	2	0	31/01/2015	15	Liverpool can leapfrog Sam Allardyce’s team with victory at Anfield, where West Ham United have not won in the league since The Beatles were at number one with ‘She Loves You’ in September 1963. Stewart Downing and Andy Carroll have a point to prove against the manager who ended their Anfield careers, Brendan Rodgers, but his team have taken 14 points from a possible 18 since losing to Manchester United and have Daniel Sturridge back for the first time since August.

270	Manchester United	Leicester City	3	1	31/01/2015	15	There is even more intrigue than usual when Louis van Gaal names a Manchester United XI due to the manager’s constant chopping and changing of his personnel. This is causing the quite reasonable question: does the Dutchman, despite his vast experience, actually know his best team? The one he selected for the reverse fixture went down 5-3 to Leicester City on a September afternoon of crazy defending from Van Gaal’s side. A repeat at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon and serious questions will surely be posed. Jamie Jackson	1	0.9898484945297241,-0.0035417377948760986
271	Stoke City	Queens Park Rangers	3	1	31/01/2015	15	Stoke City are beginning to achieve some consistency, but have lost Bojan Krkic for the rest of the season to a knee injury. Mark Hughes’s task ahead of meeting his former employers is to find new inspiration in the Spaniard’s absence. Harry Redknapp also has a pressing mission to try to end QPR’s abysmal away form. The west Londoners have lost every single away league game so far, and another defeat will put their survival aspirations in more danger. Charles Crook	1	-0.9801387190818787,-0.025805741548538208
272	Sunderland	Burnley	2	0	31/01/2015	15	How many scouts will be watching Burnley’s much coveted Danny Ings? Might Jermain Defoe score his first goal in a Sunderland shirt? Can Gus Poyet preside over what would only be his team’s second Premier League win at the Stadium of Light all season? With the Uruguayan’s recent comments about Sunderland fans “living in the past” having not been well received on Wearside, Poyet desperately needs this classic relegation six pointer to conclude with a home win. Sean Dyche’s Burnley are unlikely to make it easy. Louise Taylor	1	-0.9946568012237549,-0.0076805949211120605
273	West Brom	Tottenham Hotspur	0	3	31/01/2015	15	One of Alan Irvine’s high points at The Hawthorns was victory at White Hart Lane in September, and completion of a league double would maintain Albion’s impressive form since Tony Pulis arrived. Pulis will want to avoid a repeat of last season’s meeting when the home side led Tottenham 3-0 only to draw. Spurs arrive just three points off 4th place, and will be buoyed by Wednesday’s testing League Cup semi-final win against Sheffield United. Charles Crook	-1	0.9996906518936157,0.0008403658866882324
274	Aston Villa	Chelsea	1	2	07/02/2015	15	Ron Vlaar’s return from injury will boost an Aston Villa defence which conceded five at Arsenal on Sunday. Joe Cole may also feature as Paul Lambert’s side seek a first league goal since 20 December.

275	Everton	Liverpool	0	0	07/02/2015	15	Brendan Rodgers’ jaw almost hit the floor when it was put to him that both Merseyside rivals head in to the 224th derby in a good run of form. Liverpool have won eight of their past 14 matches, Everton two in 14. Hence his astonishment. Everton did collect a crucial first win of 2015 at Crystal Palace last Saturday and will need to maintain the dogged defending of Selhurst Park as Steven Gerrard looks to bow out of this historic fixture emphatically.

276	Leicester City	Crystal Palace	0	1	07/02/2015	15	Two home wins from 11 are a worry and though the loanee Robert Huth is suspended, Riyad Mahrez is back from Equatorial Guinea in one piece. Palace have included Keshi Anderson, 19, after he scored a six-minute hat-trick against them last week and one for the under-21s after signing from non-league Barton Rovers for £30k. ‘The headlights are still full-on for him,’ said Alan Pardew.

277	Manchester City	Hull City	1	1	07/02/2015	15	Manuel Pellegrini’s side have just endured a second bumpy patch of form in this title-defence season and as this one has left them five points behind Chelsea with only 15 games remaining a third cannot be afforded. The manager has all of his players fit – a rarity – so he has no excuse for not fielding the strongest XI and for not defeating Steve Bruce’s strugglers, who are third-bottom.

278	Queens Park Rangers	Southampton	0	1	07/02/2015	15	An ability to thrive despite upheaval is something that QPR would do well to learn from Southampton but on Saturday Rangers would much rather see Saints flop. Unfortunately for them, Ronald Koeman’s team travel to Loftus Road determined to atone for their unexpected defeat to Swansea and should be bolstered by the returns of some key players. But with Chris Ramsey and Les Ferdinand taking charge following the resignation of Harry Redknapp, there is hope of an upswing in form for QPR, too. Paul Doyle	-1	0.9884251356124878,0.988339900970459
279	Swansea City	Sunderland	1	1	07/02/2015	15	Given their recent struggles both sides head into this game buoyed by good away victories, with Sunderland finding goalscoring form to win their FA Cup replay at Fulham and Swansea shrugging off some midfield absentees to win impressively at Southampton. Jermain Defoe opened his Sunderland account last week, and his goals could just keep them out of the relegation battle. Paul Chronnell	0	0,0.9779856204986572
280	Tottenham Hotspur	Arsenal	2	1	07/02/2015	15	There were three north-London tussles last season and Arsenal won all of them while Tottenham went through another two managers. Mauricio Pochettino has been bold to play homegrown youth ahead of bigger names and has been rewarded. Both teams are on form and this promises to be another telling encounter between sides separated by one place and two points. Paul Chronnell	1	0.9998114705085754,0.9970635771751404

Darren Fletcher is set to go straight into a West Brom side looking to bounce back from their first defeat under Tony Pulis, who may decide to bench Saido Berahino after the striker’s ill-conceived interview this week.

Much as Hughes has imbued Tony Pulis’s old Stoke side with new-found creativity, Carver’s side is rather more attack-minded than Alan Pardew’s, with the previously struggling – and often sidelined – Rémy Cabella suddenly blossoming under his guidance.

He certainly talks a good game but turning around his side’s recent form will be a very tough task. However, there is no better time to face Stoke City at home as they have lost 4-1 in consecutive matches on the road.

Arsène Wenger’s side have lost once since New Year’s Day and they are starting to build some momentum. Yet Crystal Palace are likely to be difficult opponents.

287	Hull City	Queens Park Rangers	2	1	21/02/2015	15	Hull City and QPR’s fortunes both improved last time out after much-needed victories and neither side find themselves in the relegation zone now. Chris Ramsey presided over QPR’s first away win of the season and he will be looking for a repeat performance to stay out of trouble. Steve Bruce, meanwhile, will want new signing Dame N’Doye to build on his promising debut. Graham Searles	1	0.15677636861801147,0.9908362627029419
288	Manchester City	Newcastle United	5	0	21/02/2015	15	Manchester City welcome Wilfried Bony to their ranks for the first time on match-day as the champions’ quest to maintain pressure on Chelsea continues when Newcastle United visit for the late kick-off. With José Mourinho’s side seven points ahead and only 13 matches remaining, City’s challenge is to go for a maximum return of 39 and hope Chelsea slip up. As it is seven years since the Magpies managed even a draw against City in the Premier League, Manuel Pellegrini should feel confident. Jamie Jackson	1	0.0792873203754425,0.9994745850563049
289	Sunderland	West Brom	0	0	21/02/2015	15	Tony Pulis is probably the last person Gus Poyet wants to meet right now. Sunderland’s manager cannot be overly delighted at the prospect of clapping eyes on Brown Ideye, West Brom’s in-form £10m striker either as Pulis’s renascent side aim to exacerbate the Uruguayan’s recent misery. After writing an extraordinary open letter to Sunderland fans, begging for their backing, Poyet could do with his side registering what would be only their third home league win all season. Should they stumble, what happens next is anyone’s guess. Louise Taylor	0	0.2533436020215352,-0.9962221384048462
290	Swansea City	Manchester United	2	1	21/02/2015	15	Swansea City’s best performance this season came in the reverse fixture on the opening day when Garry Monk’s side pulled off a dramatic 2-1 win at Old Trafford. Since then Swansea have been inconsistent and one fears for the Swans hosting United, with their current ability to get results without playing dazzling football. Louis van Gaal knows a win is important to keep the chasing pack looking for Champions League qualification at bay. Graham Searles	1	0.0009548664093017578,0.9983742237091064
291	Everton	Leicester City	2	2	22/02/2015	15	Nigel Pearson’s bottom-placed side arrive at Goodison Park on the back of four consecutive defeats and will hope a Thursday night game on an artificial pitch has taken a toll on Everton. Roberto Martínez’s side again showed they are more at home in the Europa League than domestically with the 4-1 win over Young Boys in Bern. Confidence should have improved as a result, although Everton have won only two of six matches following European exertions so far this season. Andy Hunter	0	0.4372836152712504,0
292	Southampton	Liverpool	0	2	22/02/2015	15	This contest will provide another test of Southampton’s staying power, with Ronald Koeman’s side attempting to rekindle some of their trademark verve after one win in four matches in all competitions. They confront a Liverpool team who have found their own upbeat rhythm, with one loss in 17 and, in Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren, players who will relish returning to their former haunts. Only four points separate these sides at kick‑off. Each can deliver a statement of renewed intent with victory. Dominic Fifield	-1	0.980601578950882,0.9981661438941956
293	Tottenham Hotspur	West Ham United	2	2	22/02/2015	15	Tottenham Hotspur have begun their Europa League knockout campaign and so will have the difficult task of managing Thursday night matches. This as an opportune moment for West Ham to head to White Hart Lane and if they are triumphant then European qualification hopes will be ignited. Most importantly for Spurs, Harry Kane returns after being rested in midweek. Graham Searles	0	0.3393976092338562,0.9977403879165649
294	Burnley	Swansea City	0	1	28/02/2015	15	Burnley have travelled more miles than any other top-flight side this season so will welcome the luxury of a home fixture. Swansea are 15 points away from the bottom three, 10 points short of the top four and went out of the FA Cup at Blackburn last week and thus would appear to have little to play for in their final 12 games. Sean Dyche’s side must make the most of games like this if they are to defy the odds and stay up. Rich Flower	-1	0.9984416166941324,-0.9990628361701965
295	Manchester United	Sunderland	2	0	28/02/2015	15	Robin van Persie’s ankle injury offers Radamel Falcao another chance to impress in attack after an underwhelming spell so far at Manchester United. He is likely to be partnered in attack by James Wilson, who has, arguably, outshone his more illustrious – and considerably higher paid – team-mate this season. Sunderland, with one win from their past 10 league games, need at least a point on Saturday to guarantee they will not be sucked into the bottom three.

296	Newcastle United	Aston Villa	1	0	28/02/2015	15	Jonás Gutiérrez is expected to be back on Newcastle’s bench after recovering from testicular cancer with John Carver hoping his comeback lifts the mood in the wake of last weekend’s 5-0 thrashing at Manchester City. If Carver could do with a reassuring victory, Tim Sherwood will sense an opportunity to secure the first win of his Villa tenure. It should be intriguing to assess precisely how much more direct the new manager is making Paul Lambert’s old team. With both sides extremely swift on the break, this promises to be all about counter-attacking. Louise Taylor	1	0.9944338202476501,0.9918306767940521
297	Stoke City	Hull City	1	0	28/02/2015	15	Hull have recovered well this month after a dreadful January in which they took only three points from a possible 12. Wins over Aston Villa and QPR and a draw at Manchester City have lifted Hull to 15th but Steve Bruce is under no illusions and has warned his players they remain in a “horrible dogfight”. Stoke welcome back Geoff Cameron after a ban but are still missing Ryan Shawcross. Rich Flower	1	-0.9618676900863647,0.32299643754959106
298	West Brom	Southampton	1	0	28/02/2015	15	After losing 2-0 at home against Liverpool, Southampton will be happy to get back on the road, where recent results have been much better and helped to sustain their pursuit of a place in the top four. Ronald Koeman’s side have taken 13 points from a possible 15 away, although they will have to be at their best to continue that run against Albion, who are edging clear of the relegation zone and looking for a fifth clean sheet in seven league games under Tony Pulis.

299	West Ham United	Crystal Palace	1	3	28/02/2015	15	West Ham have conceded last-minute equalisers against Manchester United and Tottenham and crashed out of the FA Cup during a frustrating run of five matches without a victory. Yet they will be confident of getting back to winning ways against Crystal Palace, who are five points above the bottom three. Alan Pardew’s side have injury worries in attack, Fraizer Campbell, Marouane Chamakh and Yaya Sanogo all unavailable. Jacob Steinberg	-1	-0.9995515942573547,0.33869896332422894
300	Arsenal	West Ham United	3	0	14/03/2015	15	In a perfect world Arsène Wenger would be casting an eye towards Tuesday’s Champions League second leg in Monaco and tailoring his team accordingly, but so tight is the battle for top-four places, and so slender are Arsenal’s chances of progress to the quarter-finals after their first-leg disaster and 3-1 defeat, he has no margin for error against a West Ham side who have slipped to 10th but are still very capable, especially under the guidance of Sam Allardyce who will be keen to rediscover his old habit of getting under Wenger’s skin. Paul Chronnell	1	0.9966848492622375,0
301	Burnley	Manchester City	1	0	14/03/2015	15	These two sides met at the Etihad at the end of last year, and as Sean Dyche put it “a scratch of luck” helped Burnley claw back a 2-0 deficit to end the game 2-2. Dyche will have his fingers crossed for more of the same on Saturday, but the game will mean just as much to City who know they can’t afford to drop any more points if they have any chance at all of catching Chelsea for the title. Sean Morrison	1	0.9866298139095306,0.9181134700775146
302	Crystal Palace	Queens Park Rangers	3	1	14/03/2015	15	QPR have lost seven of their last eight league matches and yet they will go into this game with a degree of confidence, as they are somehow still within touching distance of safety and there has been a slight upswing in performances since Chris Ramsey replaced Harry Redknapp, even if results have not reflected that. If Rangers can abstain from ruining good general displays with sudden defensive mistakes, they might just get a positive result at Selhurst Park, where Palace remain a little vulnerable. Paul Doyle	1	0.9802491068840027,0.9992433786392212
303	Leicester City	Hull City	0	0	14/03/2015	15	Leicester’s desperate scramble for a way out of the bottom three continues, and if ever there was a window of opportunity this could be it. Steve Bruce’s Hull have won only one of their last 13 away matches, and have won only one of their last seven league meetings with Leicester. Kasper Schmeichel is back for rock-bottom Leicester, after four months out, to face a team who have failed to score in seven of their last 10 away league games. Sean Morrison	0	-0.9407937228679657,-0.9925561547279358
304	Sunderland	Aston Villa	0	4	14/03/2015	15	A big crowd, possibly in excess of 45,000, is expected as struggling Sunderland aim to end a run of five Premier League games without a win in this classic relegation “six-pointer”. Should Tim Sherwood choreograph a third straight victory for Aston Villa the mood on Wearside could well turn ugly. If Gus Poyet would be well advised to have a tin hat at hand on a day when he must cope without the suspended Lee Cattermole and Adam Johnson, Sherwood remains wary of Jermain Defoe’s potential penalty area menace.

305	West Brom	Stoke City	1	0	14/03/2015	15	After eight years as Stoke City’s manager, Tony Pulis entertains his former club knowing a win could take West Brom almost comfortably clear of the relegation zone. Mark Hughes, who has surprisingly presided over a higher win rate than Pulis since taking charge, will be looking to disturb the Baggies’ good form at home, where they have kept five clean sheets in their last six games in all competitions.

306	Chelsea	Southampton	1	1	15/03/2015	15	José Mourinho has been at pains to draw a line under Chelsea’s midweek elimination from Europe, with his players apparently fit, focused and eager to return to domestic matters where a Premier League title must be claimed. Efforts will be made to liberate Diego Costa and revive Cesc Fàbregas after recent stodgy form, and Southampton will arrive braced for a backlash and have been suffering themselves of late – even their much-needed 1-0 win over Crystal Palace was not fluent. Both these teams are in need of a performance. Dominic Fifield	0	0.9580010771751404,-0.3382786711057027
307	Everton	Newcastle United	3	0	15/03/2015	15	Two Europa League meetings with Dynamo Kyiv followed by Newcastle United and then QPR in the Premier League could be a defining period in Everton’s season and the reign of Roberto Martínez. Tension was palpable inside Goodison Park against the Ukrainian league leaders, something John Carver’s side will look to capitalise on as they bid to improve a poor run of one win in eight Premier League away matches, but Everton held their nerve and rediscovered their verve to record a merited win. They must start in that vein on Sunday with the threat of relegation creeping. Andy Hunter	1	0.9991812407970428,0
308	Manchester United	Tottenham Hotspur	3	0	15/03/2015	15	Now is the time for Louis van Gaal and his expensive squad of highly paid players to prove their worth to Manchester United as Tottenham Hotspur’s arrival for the late Sunday game starts the campaign’s crucial phase. United stand only three points ahead of Spurs in fourth place in the “rat race”, as Van Gaal continues to call it, for a Champions League berth. Next for United are Liverpool, at Anfield, before Manchester City and Chelsea are opponents in two of the following three matches. Jamie Jackson	1	0.8907365401585897,0
309	Swansea City	Liverpool	0	1	16/03/2015	15	Liverpool will arrive in Wales looking to continue the form that has taken them back into top-four contention: unbeaten in the league in 2015 and buoyed by recent wins over Manchester City, Southampton and Spurs. Swansea lost the reverse fixture 4-1 but Garry Monk’s side will not be overawed – in their last home game they came from behind to beat Manchester United 2-1.

310	Aston Villa	Swansea City	0	1	21/03/2015	15	After lifting the gloom at Villa Park and overseeing three straight wins, including that 4-0 thumping at Sunderland last Saturday, the challenge for Tim Sherwood now is to maintain momentum. With no change on the injury front, Sherwood’s only selection dilemma is whether Leandro Bacuna, who was excellent at Sunderland, should keep his place now that Alan Hutton is back from suspension. Garry Monk, Swansea’s manager, is expected to be able to call upon Federico Fernández, who missed the Liverpool defeat on Monday for personal reasons. Stuart James	-1	0.0018727481365203857,0.9257288575172424
311	Manchester City	West Brom	3	0	21/03/2015	15	After the midweek travails in Catalonia that ended Manchester City’s Champions League dreams at the hands of Barcelona for a second successive year, West Brom’s visit allows Manuel Pellegrini’s beleaguered team to get back on track. That is the hope, of course. But with a record of three wins in their last 12 outings, City’s confidence is low and Albion are sure to make this an awkward early kick-off for the champions. Jamie Jackson	1	0.000838160514831543,0
312	Newcastle United	Arsenal	1	2	21/03/2015	15	If life at Newcastle United remains one of football’s most enduring serial dramas, the latest plot-line has assumed a distinctly medical tone with assorted injuries leaving John Carver selecting from a skeleton squad. Aware of Papiss Cissé and Fabricio Coloccini’s suspensions, Arsène Wenger will sense an opportunity for Arsenal to mitigate their midweek Champions League disappointment against Monaco by continuing to conclude the League campaign in convincing style. Holland’s Daryl Janmaat, one of Carver’s two available senior defenders, will relocate from right-back to replace Coloccini at centre-half. Louise Taylor	-1	-0.9957048296928406,0.9995891451835632
313	Southampton	Burnley	2	0	21/03/2015	15	Burnley’s survival battle looked doomed at the start of the month, but last Saturday’s defeat of the champions Manchester City has the Turf Moor faithful believing again, and Sunderland are looking vulnerable above them. Southampton are involved at the other end of the table, and their draw at Stamford Bridge showed why they have not yet given up on finishing in the top four.

314	Stoke City	Crystal Palace	1	2	21/03/2015	15	Having dispatched QPR last Saturday, relegation fears are receding for Palace, but Alan Pardew will be keen for them not to get into flip-flops mode just yet. With a takeover of the club imminent, the Palace squad know an overhaul could be on the cards in the summer. Mark Hughes’s Stoke side sit in eighth, probably the summit of their ambitions, and look capable of staying there. Paul Chronnell	-1	0.9993546605110168,0.9786874651908875
315	West Ham United	Sunderland	1	0	21/03/2015	15	Dick Advocaat’s rescue mission begins at Upton Park. Sunderland replaced Gus Poyet with the Dutchman after the chastening 4-0 home defeat to Aston Villa and hope that he can steer them clear of relegation. Advocaat will see the trip to east London as a good opportunity to hit the ground running as West Ham have not won in the league since 18 January and are likely to be without several key players, including Winston Reid.

316	Hull City	Chelsea	2	3	22/03/2015	15	José Mourinho knows that with a six-point lead, a game in hand, and faltering rivals the title should be a formality. But the home draws with Southampton and Burnley and the European exit to PSG have exposed some hitherto unnoticed flaws. Chelsea need to show they are not flagging on Sunday, but Hull, just three points above the relegation places, cannot afford to be obliging hosts. Paul Chronnell	-1	0,-0.9818337857723236
317	Liverpool	Manchester United	1	2	22/03/2015	15	The fierce rivalry will have an added edge at Anfield with both teams in pursuit of a top-four finish, possibly at the other’s expense, and Liverpool looking to avenge December’s 3-0 defeat at Old Trafford. That result left Brendan Rodgers’ team 10th in the table and 10 points behind United but their recovery has been outstanding, with 33 points taken from the last 39 available. Louis van Gaal’s men must maintain the impressive shown form against Spurs last Sunday or risk being overtaken. Andy Hunter	-1	0.9981367886066437,0.982058048248291
318	Queens Park Rangers	Everton	1	2	22/03/2015	15	Everton’s long journey back from Ukraine following Thursday night’s Europa League elimination by Dynamo Kyiv, and their chaotic defending in that match, will give QPR hope that they can get the win they badly need to kickstart their survival bid. But QPR’s abject display against Crystal Palace last week must leave Chris Ramsey wondering whether he has anybody who can be relied upon to rise to the occasion. Roberto Martínez will likely be more optimistic than the home manager. Paul Doyle	-1	-0.9960126876831055,0.9054920971393585
319	Arsenal	Liverpool	4	1	04/04/2015	15	Arsenal can take a significant step towards qualifying for the Champions League and simultaneously dampen Liverpool’s hopes with a victory on Saturday. Arsène Wenger and Olivier Giroud’s manager and player of the month awards for March are testament to how strong the Gunners have been. Liverpool will miss the experience of Steven Gerrard and Martin Skrtel but Brendan Rodgers will know his side still have the quality to secure a vital win.

320	Chelsea	Stoke City	2	1	04/04/2015	15	There may be no Diego Costa from the start against Stoke, but Chelsea will still aspire to move further clear at the top of the division with victory in Saturday’s late kick-off. Loïc Rémy’s winner at Hull City in their last fixture may end up as one of the campaign’s key goals. Stoke are safe and, despite having lost their last two games, will test the hosts’ resolve. “A difficult team,” said José Mourinho. An awkward, if not daunting, afternoon lies ahead for the leaders. Dominic Fifield	1	0.007393360137939453,0.9993040561676025
321	Everton	Southampton	1	0	04/04/2015	15	Back-to-back league wins have eased Everton’s relegation worries but they remain six points shy of the 40-point mark and host a Southampton team who have regained sharpness at a crucial time in the race for European qualification. Ronald Koeman will hope the 38-year-old goalkeeper Kelvin Davis maintains the form that denied Burnley on his first league start for almost 15 months, with Fraser Forster out for the season, and his task will be helped if Romelu Lukaku fails a fitness test on a hamstring injury.

322	Leicester City	West Ham United	2	1	04/04/2015	15	Time is running out for Leicester City in the Premier League. Esteban Cambiasso said earlier in the week that staying up would be “like winning a trophy”. There might still be time for a miraculous recovery but that needs to begin with a win against West Ham. “We have to make sure we maximise our home opportunities,” said the Foxes manager, Nigel Pearson. “That really is going to be pivotal.” Graham Searles	1	-0.9255708456039429,-0.9839208126068115
323	Manchester United	Aston Villa	3	1	04/04/2015	15	Everything is suddenly rosy at Manchester United after the consecutive victories over Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool mean Louis van Gaal can look upwards towards the leaders, Chelsea, as is his stated wish. Yet as the final stretch of the “rat race” to qualify for the Champions League is entered Aston Villa arrive at Old Trafford having drawn 1-1 in the reverse fixture, despite having only 10 men for the final 25 minutes due to Gabriel Agbonlahor’s red card in that December game. This resilience means United may have a difficult time maintaining momentum though, really, given their £150m-plus summer transfer spend there should be only one victor.

324	Swansea City	Hull City	3	1	04/04/2015	15	A home match against Hull offers Swansea a good chance to pick up their first points following an international break this season. Away games at Chelsea, Stoke and Manchester City all ended in defeat and the Swansea manager, Garry Monk, says his side “have to put that right” on Saturday. The visitors will be encouraged by the return of James Chester and Mohamed Diamé from injury. Rich Flower	1	0.003595024347305298,0.9998767375946045
325	West Brom	Queens Park Rangers	1	4	04/04/2015	15	Tony Pulis was typically assertive when he said on Friday that West Brom had “gone off the rails” in recent seasons and he is looking to rebuild the club from top to bottom. He has certainly improved West Brom but they could struggle if Saido Berahino and Brown Ideye fail late fitness tests. That said, QPR’s away form has been dreadful this season, so Pulis will surely remain confident. Graham Searles	-1	-0.9787609875202179,0.5498413443565369
326	Burnley	Tottenham Hotspur	0	0	05/04/2015	15	Burnley begin the day in the relegation zone but just one point from safety. Sean Dyche is unrelenting in his view that they can stay in the Premier League and his players will need to draw on every last drop of his defiance to keep Harry Kane from adding to his impressive goal tally. Tottenham are reliant on Kane and will need him to keep firing to maintain their Champions League ambitions. Graham Searles	0	-0.8998302519321442,-0.9915502071380615
327	Sunderland	Newcastle United	1	0	05/04/2015	15	The so called “Desperation Derby” sees Sunderland hoping to assuage their relegation worries and Newcastle United aiming to end a run of four successive defeats against their detested neighbours. As Dick Advocaat takes charge of Sunderland for the second time much looks set to hinge on the likely midfield duel involving the home enforcer Lee Cattermole and Moussa Sissoko. By uncanny coincidence, Advocaat’s two immediate predecessors, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio, also faced Newcastle during their second matches at the helm, both securing slightly unexpected victories.

328	Crystal Palace	Manchester City	2	1	06/04/2015	15	The champions will be braced to start Monday’s game in south London nine points behind the leaders, Chelsea, and possibly even from a relatively lowly fourth place in the table, making victory at Selhurst Park essential. Their recent record at Crystal Palace is excellent, the hosts having failed to prevail in this fixture since December 2001, though Alan Pardew’s team have been resurgent of late.The visitors will enjoy the possession, but must be guarded for the pace on the counter offered by Jason Puncheon, Wilfried Zaha and Yannick Bolasie.

The visitors are in search of their eighth successive victory in all competitions, while Burnley have just one win from their past 10 games. Arsenal have not lost to a team in the bottom half this season but Sean Dyche’s side have already beaten one of the top four at Turf Moor, defeating the champions, Manchester City, 1-0 last month.

330	Southampton	Hull City	2	0	11/04/2015	15	Southampton’s challenge for a Champions League spot may have faded but Hull are unlikely to find them in an accommodating mood. A fifth-place finish is still very much within the home side’s grasp and that would represent a fine achievement for Ronald Koeman in his debut season. A lack of firepower has been the main reason for Southampton’s deteriorating results but their overall performances have remained impressive and they should be too strong for a creaking Hull side in danger of being sucked into the relegation zone. If Steve Bruce’s side are to save themselves, it will probably be during their remaining home fixtures. Paul Doyle	1	0.41629910469055176,-0.9630313515663147

As Newcastle United manager he lost his last four north-east derbies against Sunderland and will be anxious to see his Palace side wreak revenge on Dick Advocaat’s relegation-threatened team. Advocaat is likely to be wary of Palace’s counterattacking threat as he aims to build on last Sunday’s home triumph against John Carver’s Newcastle. Even if the current mini-heatwave continues, Sunderland’s Dutch manager is expected to wear his lucky brown winter scarf. Louise Taylor	-1	-0.9294074475765228,0.004341423511505127

How he would love to get one over on his former club and show Tottenham Hotspur that they were wrong to sack him last summer, although it is not all about revenge for the Villa manager. His team are a mere three points above the bottom three and are winless in their past three matches. Yet putting an end to that worrying run will not be straightforward against Spurs, who have not completely given up hope of finishing in the top four.

334	West Brom	Leicester City	2	3	11/04/2015	15	West Brom will celebrate Jeff Astle Day hoping to overcome last weekend’s humbling at the hands of QPR, when Tony Pulis’s team shipped four goals to leave them with only one win from their past five games in all competitions. Leicester, buoyed by a win over West Ham a week ago, need to keep building momentum if they are to defy the odds and survive an immediate return to the Championship. They sit six points from safety but have a favourable run-in. Alan Smith	-1	0.9881770014762878,-0.9909512996673584
335	West Ham United	Stoke City	1	1	11/04/2015	15	Although unhelpful, fresh doubts over the long-term future of the West Ham manager, Sam Allardyce, should not derail West Ham’s hopes of securing a top-half finish. The hosts have lost four of their past five matches and go into the game level on points with Stoke, who have lost their previous three. This hardly suggests a classic is in store but keep an eye on Peter Crouch, who is one headed goal away from Alan Shearer’s Premier League record of 46.

336	Manchester United	Manchester City	4	2	12/04/2015	15	Can Manchester United beat Manchester City for the first time on their own patch since 2011? Can Manuel Pellegrini’s champions halt a slide that has featured three defeats in the past five league games? The answers to these questions – and many more – should be known by 6pm on Sunday when whichever team has kept their head best amidst the sound and fury of the 169th derby has the best chance of claiming the spoils. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.9974958300590515,0
337	Queens Park Rangers	Chelsea	0	1	12/04/2015	15	Queens Park Rangers should draw encouragement from four points and seven goals in two games on the road over the last week, though their more attacking approach might open the door for Chelsea to revel in the west London derby. José Mourinho has no qualms about selecting Nemanja Matic or Cesc Fàbregas, both of whom are one booking away from a two-match ban before the weekend cut-off. “We need points, we need victories, we cannot choose matches,” he said. The same applies to the hosts. Dominic Fifield	-1	0.9815278053283691,-0.9952771663665771
338	Liverpool	Newcastle United	2	0	13/04/2015	15	Both managers require a response from their teams at Anfield but for very different reasons. Liverpool restored confidence by reaching the FA Cup semi-finals on Wednesday but, after consecutive defeats in the Premier League, can ill afford another slip if they are to catch any of the teams above them in the race for Champions League qualification. Newcastle should be safe on 35 points but, after the misery of another derby loss and amid growing supporter unrest, John Carver desperately needs to stem the decline.

339	Chelsea	Manchester United	1	0	18/04/2015	15	Louis van Gaal’s side will arrive in south-west London in the best form of their campaign but with their defensive ranks severely depleted by injury and suspension. Phil Jones, Michael Carrick, Daley Blind, Marcos Rojo and Jonny Evans will all be absent, but there will be no sympathy from José Mourinho. “Their squad is amazing, in numbers, players, experience, solutions,” said the Portuguese, whose side can move 11 points clear of their visitors with victory. Chelsea, who will give a late check to Loïc Rémy, know a win will bring the title tantalisingly within reach. Dominic Fifield	1	0.9992988109588623,-0.9955168962478638
340	Crystal Palace	West Brom	0	2	18/04/2015	15	This time last year Tony Pulis was being feted for his remarkable rescue act at Selhurst Park, a mantle that has now passed on to Alan Pardew who, with eight wins from 12 games, has banished thoughts of relegation. Pulis initially performed a similar feat at The Hawthorns too, but returns to Palace after successive home defeats to QPR and Leicester that mean Albion are not safe yet.

341	Everton	Burnley	1	0	18/04/2015	15	Everton will hope that the return of Romelu Lukaku will give them impetus to equal their season’s best run, five games unbeaten, as a disappointing campaign draws to a close. Burnley, glad to see the back of eight matches against the league’s top eight, will be fighting hard to pick up three points in their fight to stay up at Goodison, which is not the fortress that it was last season. This is the 100th top-flight meeting between the two sides. Graham Searles	1	-0.8463931083679199,0.0074295103549957275
342	Leicester City	Swansea City	2	0	18/04/2015	15	Suddenly Leicester is awash with optimism. Bottom of the table since November, the Foxes could leap out of the relegation zone with victory over a depleted Swansea side. While Garry Monk has to decide who to turn to for goals in the absence of striker Bafétimbi Gomis, Nigel Pearson has a fully fit squad and players who are infused with confidence following two successive victories. Erratic finishing has been a recurring problem for Leicester this season, but if they are wearing their shooting boots on Saturday, the hosts could claim a precious three points. Paul Doyle	1	0.33333486318588257,0
343	Stoke City	Southampton	2	1	18/04/2015	15	Southampton travel to Stoke hoping to keep their Champions League ambitions alive. The Saints are five points behind fourth-placed Manchester City and will believe that overhauling the champions is still possible. Mark Hughes has said he will use the game to gauge Stoke’s progress and any positive result would show they had made some as Stoke have lost to Southampton twice this season.

344	Manchester City	West Ham United	2	0	19/04/2015	15	The fascination with this fixture lies in what may happen to Manuel Pellegrini if Manchester City lose. If the champions were to suffer a seventh defeat in nine outings to continue their slump in 2015 – City were joint-top on New Year’s Day and are now fourth – the manager’s position may become untenable. In this scenario Liverpool, who are in FA Cup semi-final action this weekend, could close to only a point behind if they won their extra match. A victory, though, and Pellegrini’s garden, and that of City’s, becomes far rosier. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.19937461614608765,0
345	Newcastle United	Tottenham Hotspur	1	3	19/04/2015	15	Newcastle have lost five consecutive Premier League games and it looks as if some players have already begun to think of pastures new. John Carver will find it tough motivating his side considering their abject form and Tottenham Hotspur will be looking to capitalise on this. Spurs may also struggle for motivation, though, as it looks as if they will miss out on the Champions League. Graham Searles	-1	-0.998815655708313,-0.9545535147190094
346	Burnley	Leicester City	0	1	25/04/2015	15	Three successive victories have lifted Leicester City off the foot of the table and they will look to continue that run against Burnley, the side who now find themselves propping up the rest of the league. It promises to be a tumultuous affair at Turf Moor. Leicester are in form, while Burnley will fight until the end. However Burnley have problems in attack, with Ashley Barnes suspended and Danny Ings goalless in his past eight matches. Jacob Steinberg	-1	0.28823111454645794,0.9992415904998779
347	Crystal Palace	Hull City	0	2	25/04/2015	15	Hull City travel to Crystal Palace above the relegation zone, but if their current run of poor form continues , and the clubs below them carry on their recent renaissance, the bottom three will beckon at the final whistle. Crystal Palace have performed well under Alan Pardew and he will expect a return to winning ways after a disappointing defeat to West Brom last time out.

348	Manchester City	Aston Villa	3	2	25/04/2015	15	Manchester City have won six of the last seven league encounters against Aston Villa. It might not be a procession this time, though, with Tim Sherwood’s FA Cup finalists showing strength to turn around their Wembley tie against Liverpool last weekend. Without Belgium team-mate Vincent Kompany in his way, Christian Benteke could extend his scoring run to five games in a row. Graham Searles	1	0.9984464049339294,0.9817672073841095
349	Newcastle United	Swansea City	2	3	25/04/2015	15	After six straight defeats and with relegation fears not quite banished John Carver could do with Newcastle finally winning a game. Supporters plan to stand up en masse in the 34th minute to protest against Mike Ashley’s ownership where cash reserves of £34m sit untouched in the bank while a threadbare squad remains alarmingly under-staffed. Carver has said Newcastle may need to play ugly and there promises to be a contrast between their tactics and Swansea’s possession game. Louise Taylor	-1	-0.298759400844574,0
350	Queens Park Rangers	West Ham United	0	0	25/04/2015	15	If QPR are to accumulate sufficient points to stay up, Chris Ramsey will have marked this game as a must-win. The manager will be plotting trips to Anfield and the Etihad after this as matches they would not be expected to triumph in. West Ham, currently 10th and with one win from 12 in all competitions, are easing to the finish line and look to be there for the taking. Alan Smith	0	0.9974727034568787,0.9991180300712585
351	Southampton	Tottenham Hotspur	2	2	25/04/2015	15	Mauricio Pochettino does not hide the fact that he would rather be spared the toils of the Europa League next season, yet he will surely want Tottenham to win on his return to St Mary’s. Ronald Koeman, by contrast, is eager for his team to qualify for European competition and victory over Spurs would help secure that and also give the club more points than they achieved under the Argentinian last term. Paul Doyle	0	0,0.9535312652587891
352	Stoke City	Sunderland	1	1	25/04/2015	15	Sunderland have a number of players missing for their visit to the Potteries: Steven Fletcher, Seb Larsson, Emanuele Giaccherini, Wes Brown and Ricky Álvarez. Stoke City will have midfielder Stephen Ireland ready but will be missing Marc Muniesa. Sunderland, 16th in the league, find themselves in a precarious position and will need a positive result to stave off relegation fears. George Sandeman	0	-0.9961575865745544,-0.9909286201000214
353	West Brom	Liverpool	0	0	25/04/2015	15	After suffering FA Cup defeat at the hands of Aston Villa last week, Liverpool face another Midlands side. Tony Pulis will have Craig Dawson available but will be without Youssouf Mulumbu and Andre Wisdom. Liverpool will want to put some distance between themselves and Spurs and Southampton in the table while the Baggies will hope to reinforce their Premier League safety.

354	Arsenal	Chelsea	0	0	26/04/2015	15	Arsenal have their opportunity to nibble at Chelsea’s lead, with Arsène Wenger seeking a first victory over a José Mourinho side at the 13th try, and to postpone the visitors’ coronation for another week at least. The focus will be drawn towards Cesc Fàbregas on his first return to the Emirates as a Chelsea player with Mourinho’s sales pitch having lured him from Barcelona last summer. “I promised him he’d be an important player in our project,” said the Portuguese. “And that, normally, good projects end with titles.” The home support will be pained that their former favourite is close to achieving that aim.

355	Everton	Manchester United	3	0	26/04/2015	15	The Grim Reaper will not be awaiting Manchester United’s manager on this visit to Goodison Park. A year on from David Moyes’ final game at United, against his former club of all teams, Louis van Gaal takes his in-form side to Everton seeking to strengthen claims on automatic Champions League qualification. United need a response to last weekend’s defeat at Chelsea with Manchester City and Liverpool in pursuit but Roberto Martínez’s side have improved of a difficult season with four wins in a five-game unbeaten run. Andy Hunter	1	0,0.3362513581911723
356	Aston Villa	Everton	3	2	02/05/2015	15	With thoughts of the FA Cup final shelved this is one of three home games Tim Sherwood is targeting as Villa, two points above trouble, play for survival. With Christian Benteke in better goalscoring form than his countryman Romelu Lukaku, the manager is wary but optimistic. Everton are unbeaten in six games, last lost to Villa in August 2010 and not yet on the beach. Mark Tallentire	1	0.3406440218289693,0.9975366592407227
357	Leicester City	Newcastle United	3	0	02/05/2015	15	It remains to be seen whether the realisation that Newcastle have fallen into the relegation fight will jolt John Carver’s side into action – if it does not, then chances are that Leicester will drag them further into trouble on Saturday lunchtime by earning the victory that would take them to within a point of Newcastle, who were 17 points clear of Nigel Pearson’s side before this seven-match losing streak. Leicester played well when losing to Chelsea in midweek and will be confident of recording a fifth win in six matches. Paul Doyle	1	0.9997616410255432,-0.6228821873664856
358	Liverpool	Queens Park Rangers	2	1	02/05/2015	15	QPR have only four games to overturn a four-point deficit and preserve their Premier League status with the first of three remaining away matches coming at a ground where they have won once in their history. The statistics do not augur well for Chris Ramsey’s team but they can take hope from the hangover Liverpool have been nursingsince their FA Cup semi-final defeat. Champions League qualification is fading from view for Brendan Rodgers’ men. Steven Gerrard, having been rested for the midweek defeat at Hull City, is available to make his penultimate Anfield appearance. Andy Hunter	1	0.26231388250986737,-0.75776606798172
359	Manchester United	West Brom	0	1	02/05/2015	15	Sunday’s defeat to Everton consigned Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United to consecutive reverses for the first time in his inaugural season but Liverpool losing to Hull City then eased Champions League qualification concerns. The Dutchman put the 3-0 humiliation at Goodison Park down as a one-off. Expect Van Gaal to be a little less sanguine should struggling West Brom turn United over and make it a twice-off.

360	Sunderland	Southampton	2	1	02/05/2015	15	Incentives and subplots abound. While Sunderland are desperate to avenge an 8-0 humiliation at Southampton earlier in the season and Dick Advocaat is determined to keep them in the Premier League, Ronald Koeman remains on a mission to transport Southampton into Europe. Something has to give in this double-Dutch tactical duel but it will be no surprise if years of haphazard recruitment and general decision making continue to take their toll on a north east club who could do with emulating Southampton’s slick, intelligent synchronicity and efficiency behind the scenes.

361	Swansea City	Stoke City	2	0	02/05/2015	15	These two teams are locked in mid-table with no Europa League aspirations but securing eighth place would guarantee either of them a highest ever Premier League finish. Garry Monk described the game as probably Swansea’s most important of the season, but Stoke will rely on their top scorer Mame Biram Diouf or perhaps on another strike from the in-form Charlie Adam, who will play with a protective mask after breaking his nose in training. Peter Georgiev	1	-0.9783473014831543,0
362	West Ham United	Burnley	1	0	02/05/2015	15	Sean Dyche must have hoped that his side’s victory over Manchester City in March would kickstart a survival bid but Burnley have not scored and picked up only one point from the five matches since then, and last Saturday’s home defeat by Leicester means they head to east London five points adrift of safety. West Ham, with only one win in their last 13 games, seem ideal opposition. Paul Chronnell	1	0.5247335433959961,-0.9982945322990417
363	Chelsea	Crystal Palace	1	0	03/05/2015	15	Stamford Bridge will thrill in anticipation of Chelsea’s first Premier League title in five years. The hosts will secure the crown with victory and, given their unbeaten home record this season and Crystal Palace’s recent slip in standards with safety assured, the opportunity is there for the taking. “Them winning the league would be deserved because they’ve done extraordinarily well this season,” said Yannick Bolasie, “but we don’t want them to do it against us.” That may be wishful thinking given it is 33 years since Palace last won at Chelsea.

364	Tottenham Hotspur	Manchester City	0	1	03/05/2015	15	This one has an end-of-season feel to it. City will not win the title but they will finish in the top four while Tottenham will surely not finish in the top four and nor are they are relishing the chase for Europa League qualification. The worry for Manuel Pellegrini is that there is also an end-of-era feel to it. The manager’s job prospects at City are uncertain while his ageing squad looks set for a summer reboot.

365	Aston Villa	West Ham United	1	0	09/05/2015	15	Another home game, another win – that will be the minimum requirement for Tim Sherwood’s Villa, who are only two points above the drop zone, despite beating Everton at Villa Park last Saturday. Gabriel Agbonlahor returns from injury but will start on the bench against a West Ham side who have a chance to qualify for Europe via the fair play table. What a test for Reece Burke, the 18-year-old defender, who will be up against an in-form Christian Benteke. Stuart James	1	0.9810952146848043,0.9962419271469116
366	Crystal Palace	Manchester United	1	2	09/05/2015	15	Crystal Palace and Manchester United have both lost their past three matches without scoring a goal, so something has to give. United, who have lost Michael Carrick for the rest of the season, will hope for better. The recent wobble has left their Champions League place under threat from Liverpool and it will not be straightforward against Palace, who beat Manchester City at Selhurst Park last month. Palace’s Wilfried Zaha will be eager to show his former club that they were wrong to sell him. Jacob Steinberg	-1	-0.0030471384525299072,0.9982195496559143
367	Everton	Sunderland	0	2	09/05/2015	15	Sunderland have one home game left and they have not won away from home in 2015 – that might have to change against Everton to ensure safety. With fixtures at the Emirates and Stamford Bridge still to come, this is Sunderland’s least testing trip of the run-in. However, it will still be tough as there is a fierce determination in the Everton squad to finish a disappointing season strongly. Graham Searles	-1	0.9921318888664246,-0.9899531900882721
368	Hull City	Burnley	0	1	09/05/2015	15	This is Hull City’s most significant league game since the final-day draw against Cardiff that got them back into the Premier League two years ago. One more win might be enough to keep them in the division, while defeat would hugely increase the threat of relegation. Burnley, of course, have to win all their remaining three games to have any chance of remaining in the top flight. Graham Searles	-1	0.9996427297592163,-0.989790678024292
369	Leicester City	Southampton	2	0	09/05/2015	15	Nigel Pearson will aim to continue his side’s renaissance against Southampton who have dipped in form by comparison in recent weeks. Leicester have won five of their past six games and will know that another victory will take them toward safety. Ronald Koeman is missing key players in Morgan Schneiderlin and Dusan Tadic and could struggle to break down Leicester as a result. Graham Searles	1	-0.10236695408821106,0.9576866030693054
370	Newcastle United	West Brom	1	1	09/05/2015	15	John Carver retains sufficient self-confidence to believe that, given a fairer wind, a stronger squad and better luck with injuries, he could emerge as “the best coach in the Premier League”. Yet even the very highest-calibre coaches rarely relish visits from Tony Pulis. West Brom would certainly enjoy compounding Newcastle’s relegation troubles by consigning them to a ninth straight defeat. How Carver could do without two key defenders, Daryl Janmaat and Mike Williamson, suspended. At least Papiss Cissé should be back on the home bench, though.

371	Stoke City	Tottenham Hotspur	3	0	09/05/2015	15	Tottenham’s hopes of a top-four place were all but ended by their defeat to Manchester City, so now the race for Europa League places is on. Or should that be the race to avoid it? Fifth and sixth place will certainly qualify for Thursday night fun – but seventh will too if the FA Cup final goes to form and is won by Arsenal. Stoke are out of the running, for which they may just be thankful. Paul Chronnell	1	0.9839242100715637,0.5288789868354797
372	Chelsea	Liverpool	1	1	10/05/2015	15	Liverpool will line up in the guard of honour for the champions as Stamford Bridge fans revel in their favourites’ success, with Steven Gerrard presumably braced for a galling afternoon crammed with reminders of that slip and those spurned transfers to these parts. The visitors’ captain will hardly care, and there is likely to be a show of respect from José Mourinho for a player he has always admired. Chelsea should be rested after four days off. Liverpool, clinging to faint hopes of a top-four finish, must become the first visiting team to triumph here this season. Dominic Fifield	0	-0.01203310489654541,0.9984309673309326
373	Manchester City	Queens Park Rangers	6	0	10/05/2015	15	QPR could already be relegated when Sunday’s game kicks off because all the teams above Chris Ramsey’s side play on Saturday. With Manchester City having won three on the bounce there should only be one result. But there will be an different feel at the Etihad Stadium to when these clubs met on the final day three years ago and Sergio Agüero scored that goal. City now plot to ensure this does not happen again next May. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.33351733287175495,-0.9892968535423279
374	Arsenal	Swansea City	0	1	11/05/2015	15	Arsène Wenger is heartened by the returns to match fitness of Jack Wilshere, Theo Walcott and Kieran Gibbs but sees little need to alter an Arsenal lineup that has been unchanged for four matches in a row. “I’m ready to change but we had a stability on the tactical front, the confidence was there and I didn’t change recently.” he said. He may be forced into one switch when Swansea visit, as Aaron Ramsey is rated 50-50 after sustaining a knock to the fibula against Hull. Nick Ames	-1	0.9947592616081238,-0.9804659485816956
375	Burnley	Stoke City	0	0	16/05/2015	15	Burnley play their final home game of the campaign with the knowledge they will be playing in the Championship next season. The mood should not be too sombre though as Burnley have been hardworking and unified under Sean Dyche, a small consolation but one that should stand them in good stead for a possible return to the Premier League for the 2016-17 season.

376	Liverpool	Crystal Palace	1	3	16/05/2015	15	Rarely has a meaningless end-of-season fixture carried such emotional significance, for Liverpool supporters anyway as they prepare to give Steven Gerrard his Anfield send-off. There will be flags, there will be banners, there will be tears and maybe, just maybe, a final long-range screamer from the captain. Palace, not for the first time, will hope to spoil Liverpool’s big day. Sachin Nakrani	-1	0.9958140254020691,0.9992400407791138
377	Queens Park Rangers	Newcastle United	2	1	16/05/2015	15	QPR’s final two league games have been rendered irrelevant in terms of the club’s survival, though they represent an opportunity for Chris Ramsey to prove himself. The pressure here will be on Newcastle as they desperately seek a victory that could spare them an agonising final day. In truth, everyone in the arena will be disaffected by the way their club’s campaign has played out. Disaffection and disappointment will abound.

378	Southampton	Aston Villa	6	1	16/05/2015	15	Aston Villa go into their penultimate game of the campaign knowing that victory will ensure their Premier League status.

Not exactly roasting but warm enough to discard winter scarves – well unless you are Dick Advocaat. Sunderland’s manager has wrapped his neck in a piece of “lucky” brown wool – “stylish eh,” he says – ever since succeeding Gus Poyet and, after wearing it during last week’s rather flukey win at Everton, is unlikely to dispense with it. A game Advocaat could do with winning slightly more than Nigel Pearson. The influence of Sunderland’s Jordi Gómez and Leicester’s Matty James will be missed after both sustained serious knee injuries. Louise Taylor	0	-0.3239646752675374,0
380	Tottenham Hotspur	Hull City	2	0	16/05/2015	15	Hull City travel to Tottenham knowing that their Premier League future is now not in their own hands. However, one plus is that they cannot be relegated this weekend. Steve Bruce will tell his players that three points are essential given the form of their relegation rivals. Also they travel to Old Trafford on the final day of the season. It is obvious why Hull are favourites to be relegated. Graham Searles	1	0,0.0007907897233963013
381	West Ham United	Everton	1	2	16/05/2015	15	The intriguing subplot is that West Ham and Everton are locked in a race to qualify for Europe via the Fair Play League. Or should that be the race to avoid the Europa League? It will be interesting to see how many times Kevin Friend has to reach for his cards. West Ham may have Winston Reid back after hamstring trouble, but Everton’s Leighton Baines is missing after having ankle surgery. Jacob Steinberg	-1	0,-0.9988654851913452
382	Manchester United	Arsenal	1	1	17/05/2015	15	For Manchester United to have any chance of finishing third they must beat Arsenal, who have a match in hand, with Louis van Gaal saying: “We can put pressure on Arsenal and that is what we want to do on Sunday.” However, Arsène Wenger has a settled side while Van Gaal will be without Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Luke Shaw, and Jonny Evans and Rafael Da Silva are doubts, so United’s task is made even more difficult.

383	Swansea City	Manchester City	2	4	17/05/2015	15	Swansea have hit form as the end of the season draws near, with only one defeat in their past seven matches. A positive result against City on Sunday could even see Garry Monk’s side snatch a Europa League spot at the end of May, especially if Arsenal win the FA Cup. The visitors, however, will take a big step towards securing second in the table with a win, particularly if Manchester United do them a favour against Arsenal later in the day.

384	West Brom	Chelsea	3	0	18/05/2015	15	Diego Costa could make his first appearance for Chelsea since 4 April after recovering from a hamstring injury. His replacements, Didier Drogba and Loïc Rémy, have managed just one goal between them during his absence – although this failed to stop José Mourinho’s side cruising to the title. Albion are safe from relegation and have only £1.2m per place Premier League prize money to play for. Rich Flower	1	-0.9887968301773071,0.3954297701517741
385	Arsenal	West Brom	4	1	24/05/2015	15	Arsène Wenger has spoken of a season of progress and while Arsenal supporters are grateful not to be sweating on a top-four place on the final day, they are also rather miffed at three successive home games without scoring that do not bode too well for next Saturday’s FA Cup final. Tony Pulis’s Albion, safe and having just mauled the champions 3-0, will be out to make that four. Paul Chronnell	1	-0.9953957200050354,0.9993928670883179
386	Aston Villa	Burnley	0	1	24/05/2015	15	Tim Sherwood could be forgiven for having an eye, or possibly even both eyes, on next week’s FA Cup final against Arsenal. But even though Aston Villa’s top-flight place is safe and already-relegated Burnley are heading to Villa Park, he has vowed not to rest players. The visitors, with little but pride to play for, could still suffer the ignominy of finishing bottom if Queens Park Rangers can avoid defeat at Leicester.

387	Chelsea	Sunderland	3	1	24/05/2015	15	These sides have met their season’s objectives, which should transform Stamford Bridge into something of a celebration. Dick Advocaat’s achievement in retaining Sunderland’s top flight status should be lauded. José Mourinho, the manager of the season, would have preferred to have hoisted the silverware after the victory over Crystal Palace earlier this month but will still savour the moment as he flings more youngsters into the fray to gain experience. He pinpointed the 5-3 defeat at Tottenham on New Year’s Day as psychologically important for his team. They have not looked back since. Dominic Fifield	1	0.9730063279469808,0.9990865588188171
388	Crystal Palace	Swansea City	1	0	24/05/2015	15	Swansea find themselves in the odd position of having literally nothing to play for on the last day of the season – they cannot catch Southampton above them and cannot be overtaken by Stoke, who trail them by five points. Palace could still sneak into the top 10 if they win and other results go their way which would be quite an achievement given their situation when Alan Pardew arrived in January.

For Roberto Martínez, the aim is to hold on to a place in the top half after a difficult season and, possibly, give Sylvain Distin a more fitting end to a fine Everton career having frozen the veteran defender out of his plans since January.

This time they have to win and hope Newcastle don’t defeat West Ham. United have secured a Champions League place so will be a touch relaxed no matter how professional they attempt to be. This could give Hull the chance to pull off the required victory – then it is all about what occurs on Tyneside. Jamie Jackson	0	0.6091243326663971,0.9991021156311035
391	Leicester City	Queens Park Rangers	5	1	24/05/2015	15	After guiding Leicester City to safety, Nigel Pearson will want to end the season with a seventh home win and a 14th-place finish after being bottom of the Premier League just six weeks ago. For Chris Ramsey it is a chance for Queens Park Rangers to bow out of the top flight with pride and they could even claw their way up to 19th if they manage to better Burnley’s result at Aston Villa.

392	Manchester City	Southampton	2	0	24/05/2015	15	A season that started so brightly for Southampton has faded somewhat as the climax approaches but, after the ructions of last summer, most supporters would have gladly accepted seventh place if offered it at the start of the campaign. There is still a chance that Ronald Koeman’s side could rise as high as fifth if fortune favours them, while City are safe in second following Arsenal’s stalemate with Sunderland on Wednesday.

393	Newcastle United	West Ham United	2	0	24/05/2015	15	It is a little over seven years since Newcastle sacked Sam Allardyce. Now, on what seems virtually certain to be his final game in charge of the visitors, he can possibly help push his old club into the Championship. If John Carver has been heartened to learn that West Ham’s players were all given most of this week off, his team’s recent record of does not inspire confidence. After collecting a solitary point from their past 10 games Newcastle really are in crisis. Louise Taylor	1	-0.26744983593622845,-0.9987114667892456

Stoke are guaranteed a top-half finish for the second season in a row and have already surpassed their highest Premier League points tally, but Mark Hughes will not want to end the season with a defeat.

395	Bournemouth	Aston Villa	0	1	08/08/2015	16	The moment has arrived and Bournemouth can hardly wait to get going. Their first ever season in the top flight begins with a home game against Aston Villa, the Vitality Stadium should be rocking and Eddie Howe’s side will be determined to prove that winning the Championship was no fluke. As for Villa, there is an air of uncertainty around Tim Sherwood’s side after the sale of Fabian Delph and Christian Benteke. Jacob Steinberg	-1	0.9953122138977051,-0.7397016882896423
396	Chelsea	Swansea City	2	2	08/08/2015	16	Defeats in their final two pre-season matches plus doubts over Diego Costa’s perennial hamstring problems have given José Mourinho a major headache before the first match of their title defence. Having won at Old Trafford on opening day last year, a Swansea side bolstered by the arrival of Ghana forward André Ayew will provide a real test of Chelsea’s readiness for the new campaign.

397	Leicester City	Sunderland	4	2	08/08/2015	16	It was against Sunderland last May that Leicester secured their Premier League status and the aim is to beat the same opponents at the start of an uncertain campaign. Nigel Pearson has gone, Claudio Ranieri has arrived, and few believe that change is for the better. The visitors kept their manager over the summer and brought in some interesting additions, most notably Yann M’Vila. Sachin Nakrani	1	0.010590732097625732,0
398	Manchester United	Tottenham Hotspur	1	0	08/08/2015	16	Louis van Gaal does not wish to suffer a repeat of last season’s opening day defeat to Swansea City at Old Trafford yet he enters this match with unwanted headaches. David de Gea will not play because he is distracted by Real Madrid’s interest and to replace his No1 the manager has only the untested Sam Johnstone or Sergio Romero. Bastian Schweinsteiger, his headline central midfield summer signing, is not match-fit and, if Wayne Rooney was to suffer injury, Van Gaal has only Javier Hernández or James Wilson to replace his central striker. Given the £230m investment the manager has overseen in his 12 months in charge United should still defeat Tottenham. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.9960168997446696,0
399	Norwich City	Crystal Palace	1	3	08/08/2015	16	Norwich return to the top flight in reasonable fettle although Youssouf Mulumbu, the midfielder signed from West Brom, misses out with a broken metatarsal. Another new signing, Robbie Brady from Hull, is likely to fill in for the injured Martin Olsson at left-back. Glenn Murray should start for Crystal Palace despite Bournemouth’s interest, and Yohan Cabaye will make his debut. Nick Ames	-1	0.7991445660591125,0.9923105239868164
400	Arsenal	West Ham United	0	2	09/08/2015	16	Things have not started well for Slaven Bilic and, after his Europa League shadow team selection gamble backfired and West Ham were knocked out of the competition by Astra Giurgiu, their supporters are already grumbling. Perhaps, in time, Bilic will be glad to be free of a draining European campaign but right now he needs a tonic and Arsenal, who are flying high after their Community Shield victory, looks like a daunting assignment.

401	Newcastle United	Southampton	2	2	09/08/2015	16	Erwin Koeman, Southampton’s assistant manager, is expected to be in charge of the away side while his brother Ronald recovers from an operation to repair a ruptured achilles tendon. There is also a change of personnel in the home dug-out where Steve McClaren makes his first competitive appearance as Newcastle United’s manager. It is the former England coach’s first return to the Premier League since leaving Middlesbrough nine years ago and Tynesiders will be keen to assess his philosophy and tactics while also taking a first look at Newcastle’s three summer signings, Georginio Wijnaldum, Alexsandar Mitrovic and Chancel Mbemba.

402	Stoke City	Liverpool	0	1	09/08/2015	16	Perhaps 77 days is not enough time to heal the scars of a club’s heaviest defeat for 52 years but Liverpool return to the Britannia Stadium needing immediate evidence of progress after another summer of big investment. Both teams have undergone substantial change since Stoke humiliated Brendan Rodgers’ men 6-1 on the final day of last season with Mark Hughes making eight signings this summer, including the former Liverpool right-back Glen Johnson, compared to Liverpool’s seven. Ryan Shawcross’ injury and Steven N’Zonzi’s exit could impact on Stoke’s strength down their spine. Andy Hunter	-1	0.9855466485023499,-0.9722641110420227
403	Aston Villa	Manchester United	0	1	14/08/2015	16	Louis van Gaal’s goalkeeping troubles continue, with neither David de Gea or Víctor Valdés available for Manchester United. But Sergio Romero, with 62 caps for Argentina to his name and a clean sheet on debut, is not a bad third-choice option to have. Aston Villa’s new signing José Ángel Crespo is still out with a knee problem but Libor Kozak may feature for the first time since January 2014 after recovering from a nasty leg break.

404	Southampton	Everton	0	3	15/08/2015	16	Kevin Mirallas is expected to recover from a knock picked up against Watford but Everton will be without Leighton Baines who will miss 12-14 weeks following ankle surgery. Ronald Koeman is missing Jordy Clasie after the midfielder injured his ankle playing for the Under-21s while the defender Steven Caulker has a sinus infection.

405	Sunderland	Norwich City	1	3	15/08/2015	16	After Sunderland’s 4-2 defeat at Leicester last weekend the Stadium of Light is likely to be extremely nervous. Dick Advocaat aims to adjust the mood by offering Yann M’Vila a debut alongside Lee Cattermole in central midfield. On loan from Rubin Kazan, M’Vila has already made quite an impact, having been sent off for head-butting an opponent in an appearance for Sunderland’s Under-21s. With his consequent suspension not affecting first team games, he may well be tasked with cramping Nathan Redmond’s style.Louise Taylor	-1	0.3223237196604411,-0.9975323677062988
406	Swansea City	Newcastle United	2	0	15/08/2015	16	Swansea and Newcastle will be looking to build on 2-2 draws in their opening matches. Garry Monk confirmed that Ki Sung-yueng returned to training yesterday after limping off with a hamstring injury against Chelsea, but a decision on his fitness will be left to the last minute. Newcastle are without Paul Dummett and Rémy Cabella but £13m striker Aleksandar Mitrovic is in contention to start after coming off the bench last weekend, though the man he may replace, Papiss Cissé, has four goals in his previous three visits to South Wales.

407	Tottenham Hotspur	Stoke City	2	2	15/08/2015	16	Both of these teams lost their opening-day games so it will be intriguing to see how they approach this match – will fear of another defeat take over or will a determination to get off to winning ways see an outbreak of attacking play? Either way, Stoke’s £12m signing Xherdan Shaqiri will not be involved due to a suspension carried over from his time playing for Internazionale. Sachin Nakrani	0	0,-0.9930663108825684
408	Watford	West Brom	0	0	15/08/2015	16	If Watford have changed hugely since the Pozzo takeover, it’s probably just as well: in 11 matches against the old-style club, as manager of Gillingham, Bristol City, Plymouth and Stoke, Tony Pulis lost only once, with five wins and five draws. West Brom will want to atone for a feeble performance against Manchester City. Both clubs’ record signings, Steven Berghuis and Salomon Rondón, could debut from the bench.

409	West Ham United	Leicester City	1	2	15/08/2015	16	Slaven Bilic’s West Ham stunned Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium but he has warned they will have to perform at the same level against Leicester, who thrashed Sunderland at the King Power Stadium. Reece Oxford should start in midfield again for West Ham after his starring role against Arsenal, while Jamie Vardy is expected to play for Leicester after the club disciplined him for making a racial slur at a fellow gambler in a casino.

410	Crystal Palace	Arsenal	1	2	16/08/2015	16	Arsenal are in familiar territory. After the shock defeat to West Ham, which actually did not feel that shocking, they must, to borrow the well-worn Arsène Wenger line, show that they have the quality to respond. “It’s how you respond that makes your season,” Wenger said, for the 187th time. Alexis Sánchez is champing at the bit to be unleashed from the start but it will not be easy at Palace, where morale is high. David Hytner	-1	0.8953470587730408,0.9964048067728678

412	Liverpool	Bournemouth	1	0	17/08/2015	16	Bournemouth’s first away game as a Premier League club takes them to Anfield where Eddie Howe will be looking for his newly-promoted side to rectify the profligacy that contributed to their opening defeat by Aston Villa. Liverpool created fewer chances in their first game at Stoke City but took the three points that matter and, for all the pressure on Brendan Rodgers going into the campaign, his club have an ideal chance to start with two wins for only the fifth time in the Premier League era.

413	Crystal Palace	Aston Villa	2	1	22/08/2015	16	Three points apiece after two games is a solid return for both sides but as they face Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham next, Palace’s need is greater. There was no shame in the narrow defeat to Arsenal last week but last season’s record of 10 defeats at Selhurst Park was poor. By contrast, Villa won at Bournemouth on the opening day and will be confident they can repeat last season’s victory on Saturday afternoon. Ed Aarons	1	-0.0038490891456604004,0.9994789958000183
414	Leicester City	Tottenham Hotspur	1	1	22/08/2015	16	This week’s capture of the Swiss international Gokhan Inler for £5m added to the happy vibes that Leicester City have been emitting since their dashing start to the season under Claudio Ranieri. It will be interesting to whether Inler’s arrival will lead to the manager tinkering with a line-up that has recorded wins in their first two matches. Tottenham need to improve the support to Harry Kane and wring more resilience from a defence that folded late against Stoke last week if they are to stop Leicester making it three wins in a row.

With Wayne Rooney misfiring, the manager will more than likely lean on the fast-flourishing attacking threat of Memphis Depay to break down Newcastle. Steve McClaren will be conscious that Newcastle’s defending has to improve, after Jefferson Montero tore them apart last Saturday, if they are to secure a positive result from the encounter.

Neil would like a new striker but, for now at least, Gary Hooper and Ricky van Wolfswinkel remain options. Xherdan Shaqiri stands to make his debut for Stoke, whose comeback at White Hart Lane last Saturday suggests the Canaries will have to work hard for the kind of home win that might keep them up.

After conceding seven goals in their opening two games, even the Wearside club’s new shirt sponsors, the bookmaker Dafabet, are tipping them for relegation. Dick Advocaat aims to change the narrative but may find Montero, Bafetimbi Gomis and friends unforgiving opponents.

Eddie Howe’s side are goalless and pointless after their first two matches. Will it be third time lucky against West Ham? Slaven Bilic’s side are reeling from their defeat to Leicester City last Saturday and Upton Park will a nervy place if the Cherries pick up their first Premier League win.

It felt, at the time, as though Koeman had been lined up before Flores’s dismissal. Flores has eyes only for beating Koeman’s Southampton and building on Watford’s solid start.

André Villas Boas and Roberto di Matteo were ousted soon after defeats in the Black Country and, while the same fate will not await José Mourinho, this is still an awkward trip at a tricky time. The champions are enduring their worst start since 1998 and, having toasted the arrivals of Baba Rahman and Pedro Rodríguez, are anxious for a first win this term. Tony Pulis has beaten Mourinho with Crystal Palace and West Brom in the last 16 months. His own side’s slow start to the season could also do with a fillip.

They arrive at the Emirates with a pristine record to date, but with only one win at Arsenal in 15 years and with the hosts intent upon making amends for their opening weekend home defeat to West Ham. Arsène Wenger’s side looked more like their spritely selves at Selhurst Park last Sunday and pose far more of a threat with the forward propulsion of Alexis Sánchez in their ranks.

Aston Villa had their own scare against lower division opposition in midweek and have been inconsistent, but even in the games they have lost, they have been competitive. Rudy Gestede should be able to bully Sunderland’s fragile defence and create chances for himself and fellow attackers. Graham Searles	0	0.9988071918487549,-0.9121381938457489

But the Leicester manager, Claudio Ranieri, is also flying high as his side remain unbeaten.

John Terry’s absence is a blow, though José Mourinho will be acutely aware of the threat the visitors pose on the flanks. Alan Pardew might rue the absence of the underused Mile Jedinak with a hamstring injury though Connor Wickham’s availability after a rib injury is a boost.

For perspective, however, it is worth noting his club’s last win at Anfield came courtesy of goals from Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters in September 1963. Liverpool will equal their best start to a Premier League season after four matches with a win and are aiming to keep four clean sheets in a row for the first time since 2011.

428	Newcastle United	Arsenal	0	1	29/08/2015	16	Steve McClaren hopes Moussa Sissoko will make the team sheet after recovering from groin trouble. Admired by, among others, Arsène Wenger, Sissoko appears destined to remain on Tyneside. Having invested nearly £50m in players during this window Newcastle are adamant they have no intention of selling any key players. “We don’t need to sell and we don’t want to sell,” said McClaren who may offer a League debut to one time Arsenal target Florian Thauvin. The former Marseille winger shone against Northampton in midweek. Louise Taylor	-1	0.20821112394332886,0.9430266618728638
429	Stoke City	West Brom	0	1	29/08/2015	16	Stoke City and West Brom have made disappointing starts to their seasons with neither side yet winning a game. This will be anything but a classic. Stoke look like the more settled side of the two and on paper have the edge in attack over West Brom. However Tony Pulis will be highly motivated against his former club and will be hoping his players can rebut criticism of their early form. Graham Searles	-1	0.09974318742752075,-0.9437763690948486
430	Tottenham Hotspur	Everton	0	0	29/08/2015	16	The signing of the forward Son Heung-min will raise spirits but Tottenham still do not look well enough equipped to improve on last season’s fifth place and could struggle to get their first win this season against an Everton team who look to have more power and creativity. Spurs will need to defend brilliantly for the whole match for a change to keep the visitors at bay, with Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku in dangerous form. Paul Doyle	0	-0.2175140678882599,0
431	Southampton	Norwich City	3	0	30/08/2015	16	Norwich have four points from their first three games and Alex Neil will be looking to capitalise on Southampton’s Europa League exit in midweek by piling on more misery for Ronald Koeman. The Saints manager will be hoping his players’ focus will have been sharpened by the defeat and that it spurs them on to their first league victory of the season.

432	Swansea City	Manchester United	2	1	30/08/2015	16	Swansea did the double over United last season and have started well, with Bafétimbi Gomis scoring in the opening three league matches and Jefferson Montero catching the eye on the left wing. United cut loose against Club Brugge on Wednesday when Wayne Rooney scored a hat-trick but their domestic form has been unconvincing, with one positive being the three clean sheets Sergio Romero has kept in goal.

433	Arsenal	Stoke City	2	0	12/09/2015	16	Arsenal have endured difficulties in away games against Stoke City but things have tended to be rather smoother for them at home. They have won the past 13 meetings in north London and Stoke must go back to 1981 for their last victory. Arsenal need a continuation of the normal order after drawing blanks in both of their home games so far this season. Stoke are carrying a few injuries and suspensions but they travel with confidence.

434	Crystal Palace	Manchester City	0	1	12/09/2015	16	Saturday, 29 August at the Veterans Memorial auditorium in Providence, Rhode Island and Eddie Izzard has launched into one of his trademark rambling monologues. The subject matter has meandered on to the Crusades when the Crystal Palace associate director interjects: “… and then, in the second half, on came Bolasie and Palace ended up winning 2-1 to go second in the table.” Chelsea were beaten last time out. Now Alan Pardew’s side aim to repeat April’s victory over Manchester City, the only side above them in the fledgling table. Izzard will be performing at the the Mountain Winery in Saratoga on Saturday night. He will hope he has further tweaks to make to his routine.

435	Everton	Chelsea	3	1	12/09/2015	16	The focus will be on John Stones but not at the end of the game should Chelsea falter once more. The reigning champions are eight points adrift of Manchester City with four games gone and are still searching for the confidence, form and power that contributed to a 6-3 win here early last season. Everton’s injury problems at left-back, where the new £9.5m signing Ramiro Funes Mori may have to make his debut out of position, could be exploited.

436	Manchester United	Liverpool	3	1	12/09/2015	16	David de Gea has signed a new four-year deal and Louis van Gaal has admitted Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick (bravely) informed him the dressing room is “flat”. The latest seismic week at Manchester United ends with the visit of Liverpool. These firmest of enemies each have seven points and would love to end Saturday’s late game with three more and bragging rights for their supporters. Last season, Van Gaal’s team gave Liverpool a 3-0 schooling in the corresponding fixture. This time it may be closer. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.0017677843570709229,0.9838458597660065
437	Norwich City	Bournemouth	3	1	12/09/2015	16	Norwich seek a first home win of what, on paper, has been a relatively kind early run. They do so without the suspended Steven Whittaker, who is likely to be replaced by Andre Wisdom, but welcome Dieumerci Mbokani and Matthew Jarvis into the fold. The former, at least, is likely to start on the bench through a lack of match fitness. Lewis Grabban could return to the squad after a club suspension. Bournemouth must regroup after the long-term injuries suffered by expensive signings Tyrone Mings and Max Gradel before the international break. Nick Ames	1	0.9939682483673096,0.9510028958320618
438	Watford	Swansea City	1	0	12/09/2015	16	Their performances have been adequate, suffering only one defeat from their four games, but Watford will be desperate to get that first win since promotion under their belts. That appears quite a challenge against Swansea, who were triumphant against Manchester United before the international break and are led by the increasingly impressive and influential Bafétimbi Gomis.

439	West Brom	Southampton	0	0	12/09/2015	16	These are curious times for both Tony Pulis and Ronald Koeman. The West Brom manager, Pulis, has watched his team stutter minus their star striker, Saido Berahino, who may feature here, while his Southampton counterpart, Koeman, will have been relieved that they ended a worrying start with a convincing win over Norwich before the international break. Expect a tight contest. Alan Smith	0	0.002362668514251709,-0.9943391680717468
440	Leicester City	Aston Villa	3	2	13/09/2015	16	Last season’s edition of this Midlands derby had real niggle so both sets of players will need to be ready to be plunged straight back into Premier League mode after the international breaks. Gökhan Inler’s performance for Switzerland against England in midweek may have convinced Claudio Ranieri that the midfielder is ready for his first start since joining in the summer, but the manager will mostly be looking for more of the same from a side who have made a strong start to the season. Villa will have to improve to avoid defeat. Paul Doyle	1	-0.9701654314994812,-0.9981397390365601
441	Sunderland	Tottenham Hotspur	0	1	13/09/2015	16	Jermain Defoe would relish jogging a few memories by scoring against his old club but he must do so from a wide role, Dick Advocaat having made it abundantly clear he will not deploy him in a central attacking capacity. That job is now earmarked for Fabio Borini. Newly returned to Sunderland following his £7m move from Liverpool, Borini is already “feeling the love” from fans. Considerably less warmth will be directed towards Advocaat’s defence should Spurs start enjoying themselves. Louise Taylor	-1	0.9176872968673706,-0.9994593262672424
442	West Ham United	Newcastle United	2	0	14/09/2015	16	A fixture that might send shivers of apprehension down Steve McClaren’s spine, with memories of his England team subsiding against Slaven Bilic’s Croatia back in 2007 flooding back. Heaven forbid it rains on Monday night. “But I had sympathy for Steve because I know how it works,” said Bilic. “That wasn’t just a normal game, but he has recovered really well.” His Newcastle await a first win since his return to the Premier League though West Ham’s unpredictability, without a home point to date under Bilic, may work in their favour. Just to add to the intrigue, the hosts may have Andy Carroll back in the squad after injury. Dominic Fifield	1	0.056494176387786865,0.9951934218406677
443	Aston Villa	West Brom	0	1	19/09/2015	16	Tim Sherwood said losing to Leicester City last week was a new low but that might be nothing compared to suffering defeats in their next two derbies, this fixture followed by the midweek League Cup game against Birmingham City. It is important, though, especially with local rivals West Brom arriving without showing a hint of attacking threat against Southampton last week. Alan Smith	-1	-0.9937730431556702,0.9990984201431274
444	Bournemouth	Sunderland	2	0	19/09/2015	16	It is back to reality and back to basics for Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth. Despite having earned praise for their handsome approach, they are still without a home win or a clean sheet in the Premier League and were humbled 3-1 by fellow promoted side Norwich at Carrow Road last weekend. Sunderland have only two points from five games but will doubtless take confidence from their display in the narrow 1-0 defeat at Tottenham. Ben Fisher	1	0.8353404700756073,-0.9000199139118195
445	Chelsea	Arsenal	2	0	19/09/2015	16	This may be the kind of fixture Chelsea need to kickstart their title defence. These sides had contrasting fortunes in the Champions League in midweek and, while Arsenal will arrive with Petr Cech in their ranks and last month’s success in the Community Shield to bolster confidence, José Mourinho will spy an opportunity. His side breezed beyond Maccabi Tel Aviv with his players finally finding some upbeat rhythm, while Arsenal only returned home from Zagreb as dawn approached on Thursday. The hosts have awkward decisions to make over John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic, but Mourinho will be confident his team will be more recognisable as reigning champions.

446	Manchester City	West Ham United	1	2	19/09/2015	16	Manchester City may have gone down to Juventus in Tuesday’s Champions League group game but they still have a perfect Premier League record. Five wins, five clean sheets, 11 goals and 15 points means West Ham United will be wary on arrival at the Etihad Stadium. Yet Slaven Bilic’s team have already defeated Arsenal (2-0) and Liverpool (3-0) on their travels so it could be a tough afternoon for the hosts. Jamie Jackson	-1	0.9995629191398621,-0.9223796129226685
447	Newcastle United	Watford	1	2	19/09/2015	16	Bottom of the league, without a win and with only two goals scored, Newcastle are still a little way from full-on “crisis mode” but Steve McClaren could seriously do with a victory against Watford. A combination of some encouraging performances and a set of tough opening fixtures have, so far, kept the fans on the new manager’s side, but the defeat at West Ham looked a return to last season’s bad old ways. Another stumble could see Gallowgate Enders struggling to keep the faith. Louise Taylor	-1	0.7633121609687805,-0.3280371427536011
448	Stoke City	Leicester City	2	2	19/09/2015	16	Following the giddiness brought by their impressive summer signings, the season has not quite started as planned for Stoke, yet there is no sense of panic despite being winless. When will Leicester’s surge slow? Claudio Ranieri’s side continued their fine start by coming from 2-0 down to beat Aston Villa and will be confident on Saturday. Last year’s meetings were both decided by a single goal. Alan Smith	0	-0.9895241856575012,0.9996330738067627
449	Swansea City	Everton	0	0	19/09/2015	16	For all the early-season promise shown by Everton’s front pairing of Arouna Koné and Romelu Lukaku, it was Steven Naismith who scored three goals against Chelsea and it seems inconceivable that he will not start at the Liberty Stadium. With a fully fit squad to choose from, Garry Monk will be hoping to put last week’s reverse at the hands of Watford behind the Swans. Barry Glendenning	0	0.9840098023414612,-0.9908730983734131
450	Liverpool	Norwich City	1	1	20/09/2015	16	Norwich represent the first of four consecutive inviting home games for Liverpool that will be as much a test of Anfield’s support for Brendan Rodgers as his ability to produce a winning, cohesive team. Liverpool have been prolific in this fixture in recent years, scoring five in three of the past four meetings, but that was when Luis Suárez was destroying them. Alex Neil’s team may now also be a different proposition. Defeat at Southampton last month was Norwich’s first in 15 away games under the Scot.Andy Hunter	0	0.005317002534866333,-0.009745776653289795
451	Southampton	Manchester United	2	3	20/09/2015	16	Southampton have shown signs in recent weeks of regaining the defensive solidity of last season, while the injury to Luke Shaw means that United have some defensive reorganising to do, with either Daley Blind or Marcos Rojo likely to be deployed at left-back instead. Whichever one gets the job is likely to be tested by Sadio Mané and Dusan Tadic – pass that test and United will stand a strong chance of gaining three points at St Mary’s for the second successive season in a row after last term’s slightly fortunate victory. Paul Doyle	-1	0.007407337427139282,0
452	Tottenham Hotspur	Crystal Palace	1	0	20/09/2015	16	There have not been too many occasions that Tottenham have met their rivals from south of the river trailing them in the table but that is the scenario Mauricio Pochettino faces here. Victory in the Europa League will at least have given Spurs some confidence after drawing their first two games of the season at home, although Palace have been outstanding on the road under Alan Pardew and will fancy their chances of a ninth away win in 11 since he joined the club in January. Ed Aarons	1	0.9778979122638702,0
453	Leicester City	Arsenal	2	5	26/09/2015	16	To bet that Leicester City would be the Premier League’s only unbeaten side come the last weekend in September would have found fairly reasonable odds seven weeks ago, but Claudio Ranieri’s dynamic team have enjoyed confounding the critics thus far. Arsenal arrive buoyed by a midweek Capital One Cup win at Tottenham, but five goals in six league games is a record that needs improving. Paul Chronnell	-1	0.9969882369041443,-0.9879685640335083
454	Liverpool	Aston Villa	3	2	26/09/2015	16	Brendan Rodgers needs a win more than he has ever done in his time at Liverpool. The besieged manager accepts he is in a precarious position after an alarming spell and not even the visit of a team who have four defeats from five league games offers encouragement. Aston Villa have won two and drawn two of their past four visits to Anfield, accelerated Liverpool’s problems last season with victory in the FA Cup semi-final and have clear anxiety to capitalise upon. Rodgers’ injury problems have mounted with Christian Benteke, Roberto Firmino and Dejan Lovren joining the absentee list this week. Andy Hunter	1	-0.9887173771858215,-0.9774521887302399
455	Manchester United	Sunderland	3	0	26/09/2015	16	Manchester United can go top if Manchester City lose at Tottenham Hotspur in the day’s early match, and they defeat Dick Advocaat’s side. Anthony Martial may make his second Premier League start as the 19-year-old striker looks for a fifth goal in five appearances for the club. Sunderland are bottom with two points, zero victories and have conceded 13 goals while scoring six. United, then, should record their fifth win of the term.

456	Newcastle United	Chelsea	2	2	26/09/2015	16	Loïc Rémy is expected to start for Chelsea against the club where he enjoyed a fruitful loan spell in 2013-14 as Diego Costa continues his suspension following last week’s contretemps against Arsenal. Newcastle’s beleaguered manager, Steve McClaren, would dearly love to have Rémy available to him as his side continue to struggle for goals, a situation not helped by Papiss Cissé’s injury. Aleksandar Mitrovic is back after a ban of his own and will lead the home attack in place of Cissé – if the fiesty Serb can keep his temper under control, he has the potential talent to ease the pressure on McClaren.

457	Southampton	Swansea City	3	1	26/09/2015	16	Southampton have not fully regained their defensive solidity of last season – Ryan Bertrand’s return will help that – but they have found their groove offensively, unlike Swansea, whose strong start to the season has stalled a little as they have failed to find the net in their past three matches. Both sides will feel that a win here could kick-start the season and get them back on track for another high finish. Paul Doyle	1	0.00931277871131897,0
458	Stoke City	Bournemouth	2	1	26/09/2015	16	Stoke have endured a surprisingly poor start to the season after many predicted bright things from Mark Hughes’s side following some eye-catching summer transfers. Before the start of the campaign a home game against Bournemouth would have been seen as an ideal opportunity to get back on course but the newly promoted side have proven anything but a pushover so far despite the loss of two of their biggest signings, Max Gradel and Tyrone Mings, to long-term injuries.

459	Tottenham Hotspur	Manchester City	4	1	26/09/2015	16	Mauricio Pochettino goes a long way back with Manuel Pellegrini. The Tottenham manager was a youth international for Argentina at the South America Under-20 Championship in 1991 when he remembers scoring the winning goal in a group phase tie against a Chile team managed by Pellegrini. What Pochettino would give for a repeat scoreline against Manchester City on Saturday. Tottenham are battling to ally fluency with results while City – and Sergio Agüero, in particular – have been their nemesis in recent times. David Hytner	1	0.9593184987703959,0
460	West Ham United	Norwich City	2	2	26/09/2015	16	West Ham’s history makers, having sprung surprise wins at Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City, face a different pressure against Norwich on the basis they are expected to win. They were favourites in both defeats this season, against Leicester and Bournemouth, and have thus far revelled when the underdog. Saturday’s visitors have a dour away record in the top flight, winning only one of their past 14 on the road, but have only been defeated at Southampton since Alex Neil took charge and drew at Anfield last weekend.

461	Watford	Crystal Palace	0	1	27/09/2015	16	Palace have won five and lost just one of their past nine visits to Vicarage Road in the league, last played Watford at Wembley two years ago on the day they sealed their Premier League place, and perhaps most pertinently, have won two of their three away games this season. But they have lost their past two in the league, while Watford have won theirs. Alan Pardew has admitted the Hornets “have handled the division very well” thus far, adding that “I’ve always liked them” and “I’m a big fan of Elton John”.

Tony Pulis has had notable success in stifling Roberto Martínez’s tactics in the past and the Everton manager believes his team are facing “one of the best defensive units in the Premier League”. Everton’s defensive record is not too shabby away from home this season – they are yet to concede on the road in the Premier League. Andy Hunter	-1	0,0.9712556203206381
463	Aston Villa	Stoke City	0	1	03/10/2015	16	Tim Sherwood began life at Villa Park with a defeat at home to Stoke City back in March and although he recovered from that setback, it is beginning to look like another season of struggle for Aston Villa, who have picked up one point since winning on the opening day. This is a huge game. Villa are 18th and Stoke, who got their first win of the season last week, are two points above them. Jacob Steinberg	-1	0.00026866793632507324,0
464	Bournemouth	Watford	1	1	03/10/2015	16	Bournemouth host Watford without at least four key players, but most notably their talisman Callum Wilson, who was carried off during last week’s 2-1 defeat at Stoke. As injuries stack up for Eddie Howe, the spotlight will turn to Glenn Murray, the former Crystal Palace forward, to fill the void left by Wilson. Bournemouth supporters will switch their attentions to Mick Cunningham after 55 minutes, in which they will start a minute’s applause in memory of the former club photographer, who collapsed whilst at work during the first half at Stoke. The Hornets ought to know what to expect on the south coast, having duelled with the Cherries for the Championship title last year. They arrive boosted by the news that Ikechi Anya signed a five-year contract at Vicarage Road on Thursday. Ben Fisher	0	0.9844630807638168,0.016141772270202637
465	Chelsea	Southampton	1	3	03/10/2015	16	Chelsea’s malaise appears unending. They lost to Porto in midweek, have a manager who can’t stop picking fights with practically everyone at the club and remain without their star striker in Diego Costa. The visitors arrive fresh from beating Swansea 3-1 and should feel they can add to the champions’ woes by recording their first win at Stamford Bridge since January 2002.

466	Crystal Palace	West Brom	2	0	03/10/2015	16	All Tony Pulis wants from his return to Selhurst Park is for his team to get back to keeping clean sheets. The usually tight West Brom have conceded six goals in their last two matches and their chances of shoring things up this weekend are not helped by personnel problems in defence. Palace tend to be more dangerous away than at home but this looks like a match where the hosts will prevail. Paul Doyle	1	0.9023299217224121,-0.9978710412979126

But the way the Magpies sacrificed a 2-0 lead will have been noted, the Sky Blues will hope to prey on this fragility. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.9868537187576294,0.025345832109451294
468	Norwich City	Leicester City	1	2	03/10/2015	16	Norwich City have lost only once since the opening day and it is a mark of their quick readjustment to Premier League life that they came away from trips to Liverpool and West Ham Utd feeling that they could, and in the latter case, should have won. Now the aim is to put a run of home wins together; Bournemouth were beaten at Carrow Road last month and the outcome of Saturday’s match may hinge on how Leicester City respond to Arsenal’s emphatic bursting of their bubble last Saturday. Two attack-minded teams should produce a high-tempo, if at times untidy, spectacle. Nick Ames	-1	0.9699373841285706,0.9933146834373474
469	Sunderland	West Ham United	2	2	03/10/2015	16	Hope continues to flicker at Sunderland where, remarkably, around 42,000 tickets have already been sold for a fixture which looks ominously capable of extinguishing such lingering Wearside optimism. Lose again and questions about Dick Advocaat’s future will resurface as Sunderland head into another international break without a win. Re-energised and remodelled under Slaven Bilic, West Ham appear awkward opponents, and locals will dread the prospect of their old enemy Andy Carroll stepping off the bench and scoring the winner.

471	Everton	Liverpool	1	1	04/10/2015	16	One point separates the Merseyside rivals in the table but a gulf exists between the managers in terms of the pressure they are under, with Brendan Rodgers claiming there was a hysteria around him last Saturday and this fixture ensures there is no release. Rodgers has not lost a derby at Goodison Park and Daniel Sturridge’s return should improve Liverpool’s finishing. Roberto Martínez’s side, however, look far more mature this season with Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku improving. Andy Hunter	0	0.9985236525535583,0.005261510610580444

The focus is now drawn to the visit of Aston Villa as the latest opportunity to kickstart a campaign. Tim Sherwood arrives with his own problems, and tension mounting behind the scenes with his job apparently in jeopardy.

His Palace team have won their last three games and sit fourth while West Ham, sixth, have not lost an away game in the league and may have an extra option among the substitutes as Andy Carroll nears full fitness.

475	Everton	Manchester United	0	3	17/10/2015	16	United arrive fresh from a 3-0 loss at Arsenal but with a fit Wayne Rooney for a classic fixture that the Everton manager is delighted to see kick off at the classic time and with Séamus Coleman and John Stones back after injury. “Goodison probably gets at its very best against United and when it pushes you with that energy you feel you can cope with anything,” Roberto Martínez said.

476	Manchester City	Bournemouth	5	1	17/10/2015	16	The loss of David Silva and Sergio Agüero is a significant blow to Manuel Pellegrini yet the Premier League leaders will still expect to win on their own ground. As Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth have shown they can compete at this level, in what is their first season in the top flight, expect an entertaining contest. The hope for Pellegrini is that his side do not suffer any further injuries before the Champions League visit of Sevilla. Jamie Jackson	1	0.05026662349700928,0.9820430874824524
477	Southampton	Leicester City	2	2	17/10/2015	16	Both Ronald Koeman and Claudio Ranieri will no doubt have spent the international break satisfied at the starts made by their respective clubs. Leicester have lost only once in the league to sit an unlikely fifth, but Southampton’s unbeaten away record has not been replicated at St Mary’s, something they will aim to put right on Saturday, despite the loss of the striker Shane Long to a foot injury.

478	Tottenham Hotspur	Liverpool	0	0	17/10/2015	16	His plane was tracked, his press conference poured over and his doppelgänger spotted. Finally, however, it is time for Jürgen Klopp to take charge of Liverpool. It will be fascinating to see how the German lines up his team against in-form opponents, with Thursday’s loss of Danny Ings to a season-ending injury likely to have affected his plans late on. Regardless, expect a positive start from the men in red. Sachin Nakrani	0	0,0.8966424316167831
479	Watford	Arsenal	0	3	17/10/2015	16	The international break probably came at the wrong time for Arsène Wenger’s team – the momentum created by that dismantling of Manchester United stopped before it was allowed to take off. Yet drive is exactly what they need before Tuesday’s vital Champions League meeting with Bayern Munich. Watford beware: their visitors have won seven of their past eight away Premier League games.

480	West Brom	Sunderland	1	0	17/10/2015	16	There is renewed optimism among Sunderland fans following the appointment of Sam Allardyce, and growing pessimism among West Brom fans following their woeful recent form. While Allardyce might settle for a clean sheet as he tries to stabilise Sunderland, Pulis needs to show far more ambition than at Crystal Palace two weeks ago. Both sides look like being in a long relegation battle so can ill afford to lose to the other even at this stage of the season. Paul Doyle	1	0,0.0011281371116638184
481	Newcastle United	Norwich City	6	2	18/10/2015	16	If this is a big game for Steve McClaren and Newcastle, it is a pretty significant fixture for Norwich too. Alex Neil’s promoted team have not won in the league for a month now and they would be disappointed not to exacerbate the Tyneside misery surrounding Newcastle’s worst start to a season for 117 years. McClaren is desperate to register a first top-flight victory but could have done without needing to field Rob Elliot, his third-choice goalkeeper, after Tim Krul’s season-ending knee injury.

482	Swansea City	Stoke City	0	1	19/10/2015	16	Swansea need a victory to regain some momentum after picking up only two points from a possible 12 but Stoke, who have recovered from a slow start, will be awkward opponents. Xherdan Shaqiri has shaken off a thigh strain but the game has come too soon for Ryan Shawcross and Stoke will also be without Mame Biram Diouf, who is on compassionate leave following the death of his mother. Kyle Naughton returns for Swansea after missing the Tottenham game to be at the birth of his daughter. Stuart James	-1	-0.061355412006378174,-0.990623414516449
483	Arsenal	Everton	2	1	24/10/2015	16	After a week to remember, Arsenal fans must know a brush with reality could be just around the corner. But having ended Bayern Munich’s 100% start to the season on Tuesday, even the most pessimistic supporters must be confident. Roberto Martínez’s side are not Bayern, although they will be looking for a response having been soundly beaten by Manchester United last Saturday and could make their opponents pay if any complacency creeps in. Ed Aarons	1	0.3280381957689921,0
484	Aston Villa	Swansea City	1	2	24/10/2015	16	Make or break time for Tim Sherwood. After five successive league defeats, the Villa manager runs the risk of being out of a job if that run stretches to six. In the opposite dugout is Garry Monk, who was on the same FAW Uefa pro licence course as Sherwood and could do with a win himself – Swansea have not tasted victory since beating Manchester United at the end of August. Both managers have the privilege of fully fit squads to choose from. Stuart James	-1	-0.004149198532104492,-0.7861167788505554
485	Leicester City	Crystal Palace	1	0	24/10/2015	16	Jamie Vardy’s fine season continued when he rescued Leicester with two goals at Southampton last Saturday and if he scores again on Saturday he will become only the sixth striker – Alan Shearer, Thierry Henry, Emmanuel Adebayor, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Daniel Sturridge are the others – to have found the net in seven successive Premier League games. Palace will miss their suspended striker, Dwight Gayle, but will be keen to bounce back after their disappointing home defeat to West Ham last Saturday.

486	Norwich City	West Brom	0	1	24/10/2015	16	Norwich City’s top-flight return had been progressing much as expected, with nine points from eight games, until last Sunday’s 6-2 reverse at previously winless Newcastle. That defensive horror show would have given City’s manager, Alex Neil, a long week, even if Saturday’s visitors were beaten 3-0 in the Capital One Cup last month. Tony Pulis’s side are unlikely to be as charitable again. Paul Chronnell	-1	-0.002651423215866089,-0.9964964985847473
487	Stoke City	Watford	0	2	24/10/2015	16	Watford travel to Stoke with the ignominious title of being the lowest scorers in the league having only managed six goals in nine games. Despite being comparatively strong in defence, Quique Sánchez Flores’s side could struggle against Stoke who are building up a quiet head of steam after Monday’s win at Swansea. If victorious on Saturday Stoke should move into the top half of the table. Graham Searles	-1	0.7709288895130157,-0.0005508065223693848
488	West Ham United	Chelsea	2	1	24/10/2015	16	Slowly, but perhaps not that surely, signs of the old Chelsea are emerging. The champions have relieved the pressure on them in the past week, beating Aston Villa 2-0 last Saturday and drawing 0-0 at Dynamo Kyiv on Tuesday. Two clean sheets have boosted confidence at the back. Yet the visit to Upton Park could be awkward for José Mourinho. West Ham are fourth and Slaven Bilic’s side have already beaten Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City. Jacob Steinberg	1	0.007261812686920166,0.9335721135139465
489	Bournemouth	Tottenham Hotspur	1	5	25/10/2015	16	Tottenham Hotspur make only their second visit to Bournemouth – their other was a 3-1 FA Cup defeat back in 1957 – seeking a recovery after one win in six matches in all competitions. That said, they are unbeaten in the Premier League since the opening day. Yet, given the visitors’ venture to Brussels on Thursday in the Europa League, these are the fixtures Bournemouth should target as an opportunity. The last few weeks, as the implications of long-term injuries are felt, have been damaging. Eddie Howe will hope this occasion will revitalise his own side’s challenge.

490	Liverpool	Southampton	1	1	25/10/2015	16	After a week full of firsts Jürgen Klopp will manage his first league game at Anfield and will want his players to perform much better than in his midweek home debut against Rubin Kazan on Thursday. While Ronald Koeman will share the German’s sentiments after his Southampton side spurned a 2-0 lead at Leicester last Saturday, with a visit to Chelsea next weekend it is Klopp who needs to find the winning habit.

491	Manchester United	Manchester City	0	0	25/10/2015	16	The all-time goal tally in the 169 previous derbies stands at 249-234 to United with City winning 49 times to their rivals’ 70. If Manuel Pellegrini can earn a 50th victory for City their lead over United will stretch to five points and a significant psychological blow will have been dealt. But with David Silva and Sergio Agüero out and Louis van Gaal’s side playing at home, United are surely favourites despite the manager’s protestations to the contrary.

492	Sunderland	Newcastle United	3	0	25/10/2015	16	Sam Allardyce is the fourth successive Sunderland manager to face Newcastle in his second game in charge. He aims to secure not only the Wearsiders’ sixth straight win against their neighbours but also his side’s first league victory of the season. Standing in the way are Steve McClaren’s visiting team, fresh from demolishing Norwich 6-2. Much may hinge on a feisty looking central midfield battle potentially pitting Yann M’Vila and Lee Cattermole against Cheik Tioté and Sunderland old boy Jack Colback.

493	Chelsea	Liverpool	1	3	31/10/2015	16	Liverpool might privately consider this an opportunity to gain revenge over all things José Mourinho. Forget for a moment the antipathy which grew between the clubs during the Portuguese’s first spell in England: since he returned to Chelsea in 2013 there has been that Steven Gerrard slip at Anfield and an acrimonious League Cup semi-final at Stamford Bridge. Now the hosts appear vulnerable, languishing in 15th place with pressure mounting on the manager. Jürgen Klopp, bolstered by a first win at his new club in midweek, could lay down a marker in south-west London at Mourinho’s expense. Dominic Fifield	-1	-0.9980698823928833,-0.9005031585693359
494	Crystal Palace	Manchester United	0	0	31/10/2015	16	Even Louis van Gaal could not explain how United won this fixture last season, the 2-1 smash-and-grab having been coloured by off-colour football. United’s no-thrills style remains a bone of contention, although not to Van Gaal. “Sticks and stones,” he says of the criticism. It is the results that matter and United, he argues, are improving. “United lull the stadium and take the positivity out of it by keeping possession,” Alan Pardew said. The Palace manager meant away stadiums. David Hytner	0	-0.9759638905525208,-0.016384422779083252
495	Manchester City	Norwich City	2	1	31/10/2015	16	Manchester City have not lost since going down at Tottenham Hotspur on 26 September. They have scored 18 goals in their six games in all competitions since, five of which have been won. Manuel Pellegrini’s side are once more flying as they were before that 4-1 defeat to Spurs. Norwich City are not – they last enjoyed victory on 23 September and have lost their past three Premier League matches. There is, then, surely only one winner at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Jamie Jackson	1	0.5012568235397339,-0.9994103908538818
496	Newcastle United	Stoke City	0	0	31/10/2015	16	The 3-0 derby defeat to Sunderland was quite harsh on Newcastle considering their dominance before Fabricio Coloccini was sent off for conceding a penalty from which they fell a goal behind. The captain is available here after that red card was rescinded but Steve McClaren’s team will not find it easy against Stoke, who will be buoyed by beating Chelsea on penalties in midweek and with five wins from their past six in all competitions.

497	Swansea City	Arsenal	0	3	31/10/2015	16	The true cost of Tuesday’s Capital One Cup exit to Sheffield Wednesday will perhaps be seen on Saturday as Arsenal, without the injured Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Theo Walcott, face a Swansea side who beat them home and away last season. Swansea’s Garry Monk has no such worries with his full squad available, but is hoping to improve on a run of one win in their past six league games.

498	Watford	West Ham United	2	0	31/10/2015	16	West Ham have the division’s finest record against the division’s finest teams, with four wins in five games against sides currently in the top half of the table, but even including last week’s home victory over Chelsea they are unexceptional against the rest, and have taken just one point from two games against last season’s promotees. Watford, buoyed by a convincing win at Stoke and the possible return from injury of José Manuel Jurado, hope to prolong the Hammers’ record of upside-down achievement.

499	West Brom	Leicester City	2	3	31/10/2015	16	Albion entered the top half of the table thanks to consecutive 1-0 wins against Sunderland and Norwich but a resilient defence will face a different test in Jamie Vardy, whose 10 goals from 10 make him the Premier League’s top marksman. His relationship with Riyad Mahrez has been one of the season’s great joys so far. Claudio Ranieri, the Leicester manager, made 10 changes for the penalty shootout defeat to Hull in the League Cup but could name the same team that beat Crystal Palace in last weekend’s league game.

500	Bournemouth	Newcastle United	0	1	07/11/2015	16	Both Eddie Howe and Steve McClaren candidly described the encounter as “very important” and a lot is to be gained on the south coast, maybe even three points for one of two sides who have found them hard to come by. The Bournemouth manager has urged his team to put on a true home performance – defeat for either side would leave them in the relegation zone over the international break. Ben Fisher	-1	0.35616983970006305,0
501	Leicester City	Watford	2	1	07/11/2015	16	Leicester City will join Arsenal and Manchester City at the top of the table if they beat Watford on Saturday afternoon and with Jamie Vardy two short of equalling Ruud van Nistelrooy’s record of scoring in 10 consecutive games, Claudio Ranieri’s side will be confident of victory. Yet Watford are on a two-game winning streak and have a potent striker of their own, Odion Ighalo, who has notched seven of their 10 goals. Jacob Steinberg	1	0.9997759461402893,0.9984475374221802
502	Manchester United	West Brom	2	0	07/11/2015	16	Perhaps the criticism of Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United as a still stodgy proposition is unfair. Football is a results business first and last and the manager is doing fine in this department. The club is re-established as a challenger for the Premier League, and they also lead their Champions League group, after the midweek win over CSKA Moscow. In last season’s corresponding fixture at Old Trafford, West Brom beat United 1-0 so there should not be too many complaints if they win ugly. Again.

503	Norwich City	Swansea City	1	0	07/11/2015	16	Norwich’s honeymoon period appears to be over and they may end up glad of the points amassed early on in the season. Defeat to Swansea would be their fifth in a row, but the Welsh side have won only one of their past seven so this would appear a good opportunity to start looking towards the mid-table positions once more. An injury to the in-form loanee Matt Jarvis is a particular blow to Alex Neil while the defence will be rejigged with the captain, Russell Martin, suspended.

504	Stoke City	Chelsea	1	0	07/11/2015	16	Rarely has a contest between the Premier League’s 14th and 15th placed sides been so fascinating. Will Chelsea build on Wednesday’s win against Dynamo Kyiv or will they suffer yet another damaging loss, and against a team who have already beaten them in the Capital One Cup this season? Whatever the case, José Mourinho will have to watch from afar because of his one-match stadium ban. Sachin Nakrani	1	0.9279226064682007,-0.8645898103713989
505	Sunderland	Southampton	0	1	07/11/2015	16	Sam Allardyce is expected to abandon the three at the back formation so badly exposed in the 6-2 reverse at Everton last Sunday. That system failure increases the pressure on Sunderland to register what would be only their second Premier League win of the season at Southampton’s expense. It will not be easy, particularly as dispensing with 3-5-2 could leave the home manager struggling to accommodate both his key strikers, Steven Fletcher and Jermain Defoe. “It’s a dilemma, said Allardyce.

506	West Ham United	Everton	1	1	07/11/2015	16	Everton have not lost to West Ham in 14 league games but the manager, Slaven Bilic, a £4.5m former Blue and no friend of the fans after his scratchy, injury-strewn service in the late 90s and insistence on taking a payoff before signing for Hajduk Split a few days later, is well placed do his old club another disservice.

507	Arsenal	Tottenham Hotspur	1	1	08/11/2015	16	Victory in the north London derby would be an ideal way for Arsenal to get over their midweek humiliation in the Champions League and reassert their title-wining credentials but they will have to excel to achieve such a result. Tottenham arrive in fine form and bolstered by the return of Son Heung-min, while Arsenal’s injury list remains long with seven players definitely out and three more doubtful.

508	Aston Villa	Manchester City	0	0	08/11/2015	16	Welcome to the Premier League, Rémi Garde. Bottom versus top at Villa Park and, on the face of it, there looks to be only one result. City have won seven of their last eight in all competitions and Villa, on their worst run of defeats since 1963, have taken one point from a possible 30. Micah Richards will be back from suspension to face his former club, although it is another reunion, involving Fabian Delph and Villa, that will be much more eagerly anticipated.

509	Liverpool	Crystal Palace	1	2	08/11/2015	16	Jürgen Klopp’s tenure at Liverpool remains in its embryonic stage, but there are signs he is beginning to leave his mark. Certainly the defence appear more resilient – conceding just once in their past three games, all of which ended in victory. Klopp named a strong team for the trip to Rubin Kazan on Thursday, however, and Palace will be desperate to end a run of three matches without a win.

510	Chelsea	Norwich City	1	0	21/11/2015	16	Norwich City’s encouraging victory over Swansea means Alex Neil’s side travel to Stamford Bridge above the ailing champions in the Premier League table. However it is 22 years since their last win at the ground, so they will still be braced for an awkward afternoon. José Mourinho has had a fortnight to stew over the loss at Stoke, a third league defeat in succession, which he watched from the team’s hotel. Still backed by the club’s hierarchy, who have promised to be even more supportive, he will be back on the touchline on Saturday seeking a reaction and a step forward on the road to recovery.

511	Everton	Aston Villa	4	0	21/11/2015	16	Rémi Garde takes charge of his second game as Aston Villa manager and has had much more time to prepare than the three days before Villa’s draw with Manchester City. However, Garde’s inexperience in England could still show in his first away trip. Despite needing a victory Villa would be happy to leave Goodison with a point but Roberto Martínez will be expecting all three, especially after Everton’s 6-2 roasting of Sunderland.

512	Manchester City	Liverpool	1	4	21/11/2015	16	Sergio Agüero is available to start after nine matches out but this might be a contest where the Klopp factor has made an impact on Liverpool’s performance by the final whistle. A draw at the Etihad Stadium, which can be a graveyard for the very best sides, would be a fine result for Jürgen Klopp’s men.

513	Newcastle United	Leicester City	0	3	21/11/2015	16	Should Jamie Vardy pass a late fitness test and start for Leicester many Newcastle fans will probably feel like watching the striker’s expected duel with Fabricio Coloccini through their fingers. Small wonder Tynesiders are keeping everything crossed that Vardy’s extraordinary scoring streak is halted – temporarily at least – by the hip injury that leaves him touch and go for Saturday. With Leicester supreme on the counterattack, Claudio Ranieri aims to continue confounding the doubters but Steve McClaren is confident his Newcastle side are “turning a corner”.

514	Southampton	Stoke City	0	1	21/11/2015	16	Southampton have lost just one of their past 10 league games and are seventh, just one point behind Tottenham in fifth. Ronald Koeman will have his work cut out against Stoke, though. Mark Hughes’s side have been much improved since Ryan Shawcross’s return, beating Chelsea before the international break at the Britannia Stadium. Jonathan Walters is fresh from firing Ireland into Euro 2016 and Hughes will hope he can reproduce that form on Saturday. Graham Searles	-1	0.968353271484375,0.33358583847681683
515	Swansea City	Bournemouth	2	2	21/11/2015	16	Garry Monk may have dismissed speculation about his position as Swansea’s manager as being generated by “outside influence” but if his side lose at home to Bournemouth, who are without a win in six league games, it will only increase the pressure. Monk, who has a fully-fit squad to choose from, may be suffering from the raised expectations generated by last season’s record points haul. Bournemouth have lacked a cutting edge since Callum Wilson’s serious knee injury and Eddie Howe needs Joshua King to fill the void in the attacking third.

516	Watford	Manchester United	1	2	21/11/2015	16	Manchester United will go top for at least a couple of hours if they beat Watford, but they could be weighed down by problems in attack. Wayne Rooney, Anthony Martial and Marouane Fellaini are injured, while Louis van Gaal says that James Wilson is not ready to play 90 minutes, and United’s list of absentees will boost Watford’s hopes of pulling off a famous win. United’s defence will not relish the task of containing Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo. Jacob Steinberg	-1	0.9971631169319153,-0.33503369490305585
517	West Brom	Arsenal	2	1	21/11/2015	16	Tony Pulis says the West Brom job is the hardest of his career and pleaded for time to make the changes that he wants. But Albion fans are growing impatient with the negativity on display from their team so far this season. An enterprising performance and victory over Arsenal would be ideally timed, and Arsenal’s injury problems may help. But Arsène Wenger’s side have shown steel as well as style this season and it is difficult to see them slipping up at The Hawthorns. Paul Doyle	1	-0.9955182075500488,0.13304972648620605
518	Crystal Palace	Sunderland	0	1	23/11/2015	16	On paper this fixture looks like a routine home win. After all, Crystal Palace come into it having beaten Liverpool at Anfield prior to the international break while Sunderland lost again, this time to Southampton. Sam Allardyce feels his team are “playing with fear” and he must hope memories of winning 3-1 at Selhurst Park last season can provide them with a shot of confidence.

It remains to be seen whether the banishment of Grealish, one of the brightest prospects in a struggling side, will serve to galvanise the youngster but Watford will surely be glad he is absent for such a crucial game near the foot of the table.

520	Bournemouth	Everton	3	3	28/11/2015	16	It is over two months since Bournemouth last won a league game – 2-0 against Sunderland – and they have not kept a clean sheet since. It leaves only Aston Villa beneath them in the table and with Chelsea and Manchester United after this another defeat could leave them in dire straits. Everton are big favourites to complete a south coast double having dismantled Southampton earlier in the season. Romelu Lukaku has seven goals from as many games and Roberto Martínez’s team have 11 in their last three, so expect goals. Alan Smith	0	-0.9983074963092804,0.08136838674545288
521	Crystal Palace	Newcastle United	5	1	28/11/2015	16	Palace host a second side from the north-east in less than a week and Alan Pardew will be desperate to improve on the Sunderland performance when they take on the side he left in January after five years in charge. Marouane Chamakh came on in that one and is an option again after injury while Newcastle, who have not lost to Palace since 1998, should have Jack Colback available again.

522	Leicester City	Manchester United	1	1	28/11/2015	16	Jamie Vardy could break a Premier League record by scoring in an 11th consecutive game against the very team that the current holder, Ruud van Nistelrooy, set the benchmark for 12 years ago. Louis van Gaal has described Vardy as a “nasty” problem for Manchester United and a “great” player but he will be just as wary of the threat posed by the in-form Riyad Mahrez. United have the meanest defence in the top flight so a repeat of last season’s 5-3 win for Leicester would appear unlikely. Rich Flower	0	0.9991575479507446,-0.9621571898460388
523	Manchester City	Southampton	3	1	28/11/2015	16	Manchester City last won a Premier League game on the final day of October – five matches ago. Southampton have two victories from their past three top-flight games and know this is a chance to narrow the deficit on their third-placed opponents to three points. Given the three steps forward one step back nature of this City team it would be no surprise if Ronald Koeman’s side departed with the spoils. Jamie Jackson	1	0.00499764084815979,0.996224045753479
524	Sunderland	Stoke City	2	0	28/11/2015	16	Can Jack Butland break a club record set by Gordon Banks 45 years ago? By keeping clean sheets in Stoke’s past five away games in all competitions, the goalkeeper has already equalled it and now hopes to create a bit of history. With survival Sunderland’s sole concern, Sam Allardyce is expected to retain his new, opponent smothering, 3-5-2 formation. Considering Mark Hughes’s otherwise impressive team often struggle to score, the thrill factor could be on the low side. Louise Taylor	1	0.9753291606903076,0.0028173625469207764
525	Liverpool	Swansea City	1	0	29/11/2015	16	With one win in 10 matches a visit to Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool looks ominous for Garry Monk but, with Philippe Coutinho struggling with a hamstring problem and Lucas Leiva suspended, and the two have been key to their team’s recovery under the former Borussia Dortmund coach, Swansea will hope to frustrate at Anfield. Klopp has called for Liverpool to bring the devastating form that mauled Manchester City last weekend home with them. He is yet to taste a Premier League victory at Anfield but five wins from six matches in all competitions suggests the wait will not continue for long. Andy Hunter	1	-0.713844895362854,0
526	Norwich City	Arsenal	1	1	29/11/2015	16	Arsenal’s away form in the Premier League has been good – nobody has taken more points than them – but, as last weekend’s crash at West Brom showed, they remain prone to the odd nightmare. Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez were in top form as they bounced back to beat Dinamo Zagreb at home on Tuesday and they ought to have too much for a Norwich team that has endured a very difficult past two months. It is rarely that straightforward. David Hytner	0	-0.9788660407066345,-0.982277899980545
527	Tottenham Hotspur	Chelsea	0	0	29/11/2015	16	Tottenham Hotspur will attempt to extend the top flight’s longest current unbeaten run to 13 matches against the champions on Sunday, though they must shrug off a six-and-a-half-hour flight from Baku following Thursday’s win at Qarabag in the Europa League. There was little sympathy from José Mourinho for their plight, the Chelsea manager pointing to the unforgiving schedule around the Champions League semi-final against Atlético Madrid in 2014. In truth, the Portuguese has his own problems with John Terry and Ramires to be assessed on Saturday after picking up injuries in Israel in midweek.

528	West Ham United	West Brom	1	1	29/11/2015	16	West Ham have not won since defeating Chelsea on 24 October, which will have prompted fears one of the club’s traditional mid-season slumps might be brewing. Last week’s mauling at Tottenham was certainly chastening and Slaven Bilic, shorn of his most creative player, Dimitri Payet, is also without his suspended captain Mark Noble against an Albion side buoyed by beating Arsenal 2-1. Tom Davies	0	-0.9714963138103485,0
529	Arsenal	Sunderland	3	1	05/12/2015	16	As if Arsène Wenger were not sufficiently stressed out by injuries and dropped points, he can now see his old rival, Sam Allardyce, riding into town, ready to add to his woes. Allardyce has tightened Sunderland up, led them to morale-boosting victories and he will ask a simple question of Arsenal – ‘Can you break us down?’ The animosity between the two has cooled but there is still no love lost. There could be even less by Saturday evening. David Hytner	1	0.9890314936637878,0.004870682954788208
530	Chelsea	Bournemouth	0	1	05/12/2015	16	Chelsea have kept three straight clean sheets, representative of an upturn in form of sorts, but will hope to extend their mini-revival against a Bournemouth side whose progress remains horribly undermined by injuries. Should Artur Boruc not prove his fitness then Ryan Allsop will start in goal with the teenager Jordan Holmes on the bench. The Australian was playing on loan with Weymouth in front of 349 fans at Hemel Hempstead last Saturday. His parents, over for Christmas, arrive on the day of the game and will presumably head straight for Stamford Bridge. Dominic Fifield	-1	-0.06168767809867859,0.9770432114601135
531	Manchester United	West Ham United	0	0	05/12/2015	16	Manchester United are third and only a point behind Leicester and Manchester City despite having played tepid football so far. West Ham United have beaten Arsenal, Liverpool and City on the road, and Chelsea at home. The success of Van Gaal’s team is built on a Scrooge-like defence, while Slaven Bilic’s men are unfazed by playing more heralded names. This could be a draw.

532	Southampton	Aston Villa	1	1	05/12/2015	16	Three defeats in a row – the latest being that 6-1 home thrashing by Liverpool on Wednesday – has put pressure on Southampton and that could spell more bad news for Aston Villa. If Rémi Garde’s side are to inflict more pain on the Saints rather than extend their own hapless streak, then Adam Traoré, their lone shining light in last week’s defeat by Watford, will probably have to excel. But even that may not be enough against a Southampton side with superior quality in every position. Paul Doyle	0	0.32681624094645184,0
533	Stoke City	Manchester City	2	0	05/12/2015	16	The Stoke captain, Ryan Shawcross, will be a welcome return for Mark Hughes after his side suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Sunderland last Saturday. Meanwhile, Manuel Pellegrini will be without Sergio Agüero and a host of other first-team regulars. Hughes should be plotting an upset of his own on Saturday but Manchester City still have an embarassment of attacking riches that could make light work of Stoke.

534	Swansea City	Leicester City	0	3	05/12/2015	16	Can Swansea be the team to stop Jamie Vardy from equalling the all-time top-flight goal record by scoring for a 12th successive game? On recent evidence, maybe not. Garry Monk’s team have not kept a clean sheet since drawing with Everton on 19 September, though their biggest worry at present is finding their opposition’s goal. Swansea have not scored in six of their past 10 games and that must improve if they are to stay above trouble. Alan Smith	-1	-0.9928136269251505,0
535	Watford	Norwich City	2	0	05/12/2015	16	Norwich City travel to Vicarage Road buoyed by the point they earned against Arsenal last Sunday. However, Alex Neil will also be aware his side have won just once on the road in seven attempts this season. If Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney can continue combining as effectively as they have done so far then Quique Sánchez Flores will be confident Watford can secure victory.

536	West Brom	Tottenham Hotspur	1	1	05/12/2015	16	Mauricio Pochettino has made no secret of wanting to buy another forward in January and will hope to check up on Saido Berahino, who threatened to go on strike after Spurs’ fourth bid for him was rejected last summer and has since managed three league goals. Albion have Chris Brunt available while a result for Spurs would equal the undefeated top-flight run of 14 from 1985. Mark Tallentire	0	0,0.9984071254730225
537	Newcastle United	Liverpool	2	0	06/12/2015	16	Steve McClaren could probably do without facing Jürgen Klopp’s renascent Liverpool in front of live television cameras. After presiding over only two league wins all season, Newcastle’s manager acknowledges he is in the dark about his precarious looking future on Tyneside and is unlikely to be cheered by memories of the last time he met Klopp. In 2011 a Bundesliga win for the German’s Dortmund side at McClaren’s Wolfsburg proved the Englishman’s penultimate game in charge before his sacking.

538	Everton	Crystal Palace	1	1	07/12/2015	16	Something about Merseyside brings the best out of Crystal Palace. The only team to have beaten Jürgen Klopp at Anfield this season have won their last two visits to Goodison Park 3-2 and confidence will not be an issue after their 5-1 trouncing of Newcastle United last weekend. Everton, who will give a late fitness test to James McCarthy, may have advanced into the Capital One Cup semi-finals in midweek but the two points dropped at Bournemouth still hurt Roberto Martínez. His team need a response. Andy Hunter	0	-0.005851775407791138,0.01013299822807312
539	Bournemouth	Manchester United	2	1	12/12/2015	16	Eddie Howe and Louis van Gaal have had very different weeks. If the Dutchman thought the goalless draw with West Ham was bad, he entered a whole new level of Old Trafford despair following defeat at Wolfsburg and a Champions League exit. However, United remain three points off the top but know that Bournemouth, buoyed by their fine win at Chelsea, could complete a quite miserable week.

540	Crystal Palace	Southampton	1	0	12/12/2015	16	Southampton would normally consider a trip to Selhurst Park appealing. They have won their last seven league games against Crystal Palace, matches played in the top two divisions, and cost Neil Warnock his job with a 3-1 success in south London a year ago. Yet they arrive amid a dip in form and Alan Pardew’s team will offer more of a test, particularly as they look to build upon last month’s 5-1 thrashing of Newcastle and improve upon their own indifferent home record. The return of Wilfried Zaha from suspension will add to their armoury, with this a reunion with former employers for Pardew, José Fonte and Jason Puncheon.

541	Manchester City	Swansea City	2	1	12/12/2015	16	Manchester City face a side who are without a manager following the sacking of Garry Monk. This means Manuel Pellegrini’s team face an unknown proposition: the state of flux could be an advantage to them, or Swansea may be doubly determined to win this game for Monk. Either way following the fine midweek 4-2 victory over Borussia Mönchengladbach City will expect to draw level with the leaders Leicester, who are not in action until Monday evening’s visit of Chelsea.

542	Norwich City	Everton	1	1	12/12/2015	16	Norwich’s inability to string a run of form together has done a disservice to their general play but the time for results is fast approaching. They visit Manchester United and Tottenham after this and Alex Neil could do with a performance against Everton that renders his attacking players, in particular, undroppable. He has chopped and changed in recent weeks without finding an effective combination; whoever is selected for this assignment should take heart that, at the worst, Roberto Martínez’s side usually give you a chance.

543	Sunderland	Watford	0	1	12/12/2015	16	Quique Sánchez Flores seems slightly offended by Sam Allardyce’s assertion that this ranks as a relegation six-pointer. “I understand what he’s saying but I will never in my life agree,” said Watford’s manager whose side sit 10th. “I have a different mentality.” Much may hinge on how the respective defences cope with Sunderland’s Duncan Watmore and Watford’s Odion Ighalo but Flores relishes the challenge ahead. “The atmosphere at their stadium will be amazing,” he said. “Sam Allardyce has changed Sunderland’s dynamic. We have to be ready to face several different systems.” Louise Taylor	-1	0.9977546334266663,0.19895862340927123
544	West Ham United	Stoke City	0	0	12/12/2015	16	The unpredictable nature of this season’s Premier League means that neither West Ham United nor Stoke City should be discounted as contenders for a European place. However, West Ham’s momentum has stalled. They have not won since beating Chelsea on 24 October and could be missing six key players, while Stoke will be confident after last weekend’s comprehensive victory over Manchester City. Mark Hughes’s side are unbeaten in their past three visits to Upton Park. Jacob Steinberg	0	-0.3299805720647176,0.9996157884597778
545	Aston Villa	Arsenal	0	2	13/12/2015	16	With Arsène Wenger in one dugout and Rémi Garde, the former Arsenal midfielder, in the other, this is a classic case of the master coming up against the apprentice. On the face of it there looks only one winner. Aston Villa, for whom Jack Grealish is back in contention after a spell on the naughty step, have gone a club-record 14 league games without a win and look nailed-on relegation candidates. Arsenal, on the other hand, ought to be oozing confidence after their emphatic midweek victory over Olympiakos. Stuart James	-1	-0.9917318224906921,0.923256903886795
546	Liverpool	West Brom	2	2	13/12/2015	16	Jürgen Klopp will be seeking an immediate league response from his Liverpool side following their shock 2-0 defeat at St James’ Park last Sunday. They will be without Daniel Sturridge after he strained his hamstring at Newcastle. However, the in-form playmaker Philippe Coutinho could return to the starting lineup following his cameo from the bench in the Europa League against an Albion side sure to concede possession as they look to make it four consecutive league games without defeat. Conor Creamer	0	-0.8005219995975494,0
547	Tottenham Hotspur	Newcastle United	1	2	13/12/2015	16	The relief for Steve McClaren was palpable. “It looked like we’d never win another game,” Newcastle’s manager said, with a nod towards the mood after the defeats against Leicester and Crystal Palace, but win they did against Liverpool last Sunday. McClaren feels a little more secure, after his players produced a performance of hard running and focus, but it does not get any easier for him. Tottenham, unbeaten in 14 matches, have been outrun by very few opponents. David Hytner	-1	0.9549765288829803,0.9797005454699198
548	Leicester City	Chelsea	2	1	14/12/2015	16	Last season’s champions meet last season’s great escapees but the roles are curiously reversed as the Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez-propelled Foxes take on a Chelsea side looking nervously over their shoulders at the relegation zone only two points beneath them. Together Vardy and Mahrez have found the net seven times more than Chelsea this season, while Willian is the player José Mourinho will look to for inspiration at the other end.

549	Chelsea	Sunderland	3	1	19/12/2015	16	For the second time in eight years José Mourinho has been sacked by Chelsea and interest lies in just how the team reacts. They desperately need a win against opponents who also find themselves in relegation strife and the suspicion is that with Guus Hiddink poised to take over on a temporary basis again, the hosts will rise to the occasion now the man who accused them of a “betrayal” has left. Sachin Nakrani	1	0.5427640080451965,0
550	Everton	Leicester City	2	3	19/12/2015	16	Goodison Park would represent a significant test of Leicester City’s staying power even without Claudio Ranieri losing several key players to injury and suspension. Robert Huth, Danny Drinkwater and Jeffrey Schlupp will all be absent against an Everton team that is pleasing on the eye but not satisfying supporters with recent results. The league’s leading goalscorers, Jamie Vardy and Romelu Lukaku, go head to head on what feels an important afternoon for both managers. Andy Hunter	-1	-0.9966809153556824,0.9992126524448395
551	Manchester United	Norwich City	1	2	19/12/2015	16	Louis van Gaal desperately needs the elixir of a victory. It could be scrappy, ugly and even achieved in the pedestrian style many Manchester United supporters have come to detest. To cast Norwich City in the role of easy victims is wrong. Still, if United cannot defeat a side who are third from bottom and have just 14 points then the Old Trafford crowd could turn spiteful come 5pm on Saturday.

552	Newcastle United	Aston Villa	1	1	19/12/2015	16	Eleven months ago Rémi Garde seemed close to succeeding Alan Pardew at Newcastle but talks foundered and he now finds himself in charge of another club with a dubious recruitment policy – bottom-placed Aston Villa. Despite successive, morale-boosting wins against Liverpool and Spurs, Steve McClaren’s side remain vulnerable and will surely need to modify their recent counterattacking strategy against Garde’s side. Villa, though, have now gone 15 League games without victory. A few more stumbles and the Championship will be within touching distance. Louise Taylor	0	0,-0.9976973334948221
553	Southampton	Tottenham Hotspur	0	2	19/12/2015	16	Three defeats in four league games – as well as that chastening Capital One Cup defeat to Liverpool – have taken the sheen off Southampton’s start to the season and the visit of their former manager, Mauricio Pochettino, presents a good opportunity to blow the cobwebs away. Another defeat or two could see them looking over their shoulders and Ronald Koeman will be hoping that Graziano Pellè, who had an injection to his injured knee, will be fit and perform somewhere close to his brilliant best. Nick Ames	-1	0.9589640200138092,0
554	Stoke City	Crystal Palace	1	2	19/12/2015	16	Stoke City and Crystal Palace are two of the most physically dominant sides in the league and both will look to dominate the other from the outset. Mark Hughes should have the edge, however, as Stoke beat Manchester City emphatically in their last home fixture. Goals will be at a premium as Stoke have kept clean sheets in seven of their last nine league games and Palace have conceded only six away from home this season. Graham Searles	-1	0.9952313701311747,0
555	West Brom	Bournemouth	1	2	19/12/2015	16	Bournemouth have shrugged off their injury crisis and have shown excellent spirit to beat Chelsea and Manchester United consecutively. Eddie Howe will not be daunted by visiting The Hawthorns after such great results but Tony Pulis will have prepared West Brom accordingly to try to halt their progression. The fact the visitors concede more than two goals per game on the road could prove a telling statistic. Graham Searles	-1	0.8358858227729797,0.9997753500938416
556	Swansea City	West Ham United	0	0	20/12/2015	16	If Swansea can produce the energetic display that almost enabled them to snatch a draw last Saturday at Manchester City they could have the beating of West Ham, who remain stricken by multiple key injuries. Slaven Bilic’s attacking replacements have not been able to fill the void left by Dimitri Payet, in particular, but Bilic should still be faithful against Swansea, who have not won in their last six league games.

The Hornets have won all of their past three games – and their opponents none of theirs – and the continued absence of the hamstrung Daniel Sturridge will make the Reds’ task more difficult against a home side who have no significant injuries and have yet to lose this season against any side below them in the league.

559	Aston Villa	West Ham United	1	1	26/12/2015	16	Aston Villa, without a victory since the opening day of the season, will fancy their chances against a West Ham side that have not had a win since 24 October. It is surely not coincidental that the slump in form for Slaven Bilic’s side has come while Dimitri Payet has been absent with an ankle injury and his return in the new year will be welcome. Rémi Garde can draw little comfort from the fact he has almost a full squad to choose from as his crop of players have proved inadequate thus far. Rich Flower	0	0.3329630494117737,-0.8028237819671631
560	Bournemouth	Crystal Palace	0	0	26/12/2015	16	The firepower in Crystal Palace’s final third can scare most teams – including Bournemouth – who have kept just two clean sheets this season. The Cherries will attempt to mute the threat of the much admired duo of Yannick Bolasie and Wilfried Zaha but they, too, possess star quality in the wide areas. Two of the division’s form sides meet, with the home side unbeaten in five while Palace arrive on the south coast looking up at the top four. Ben Fisher	0	0.9945133924484253,0.9994238018989563
561	Chelsea	Watford	2	2	26/12/2015	16	Watford should offer a far sterner test of Chelsea’s capabilities than Sunderland last Saturday, with this a potentially enlightening afternoon for Guus Hiddink. The Dutchman’s second spell in interim charge will begin with a late fitness test for Eden Hazard and a reminder to his players that fourth place is still attainable if an instant upturn in form can be instigated. Not that the visitors will be shrinking at the thought of what awaits. They will aspire to securing a first win in this arena since May 1986 when David Bardsley scored twice in a 5-1 win.

Jürgen Klopp’s men have collected only one point from the past nine available and, with Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez in town, have suffered the untimely loss of Martin Skrtel to a hamstring injury. With Dejan Lovren returning to training only on Wednesday, Klopp may have to make do with Kolo Touré and Mamadou Sakho at the heart of defence for Liverpool’s 4,000th game in the top flight.

563	Manchester City	Sunderland	4	1	26/12/2015	16	It is hard to think of a worse place for Sam Allardyce’s side to be visiting on the back of three defeats – Sunderland have not won at Manchester City since Janaury 1998, when Kevin Phillips got the only goal of the game. The Sunderland manager has recalled Jeremain Lens to the squad after a disciplinary incident earlier in the month and called on the £8m signing to “prove that he’s an immense talent”, it will be interesting to see how the Dutchman responds.

564	Newcastle United	Everton	0	1	26/12/2015	16	Much may hinge on the respective performances of two former Anderlecht centre-forwards, Newcastle’s Aleksandar Mitrovic and Everton’s Romelu Lukaku. Although Steve McClaren’s side have shown signs of definite improvement in recent weeks they remain fourth bottom – not great for a club whose declared pre-season target was a top eight place. Accordingly Mike Ashley, the owner, will want to see evidence that the recent mini renaissance is genuine. A lot here though could depend on how Paul Dummett copes with Everton’s Gerard Deulofeu.

565	Southampton	Arsenal	4	0	26/12/2015	16	This fixture has unhappy memories for Arsenal from last season. They lost it 2-0 on New Year’s Day, after two Wojciech Szczesny errors, and then there was a kerfuffle about the goalkeeper smoking by the showers afterwards. And yet it was to be a turning point. Since then, Arsenal have lost only five Premier League matches and they return to St Mary’s with genuine title hopes. Southampton desperately need a tonic after a run of five losses and a draw.

United have fallen nine points off the lead and Van Gaal’s assertion that they could be top in the next four weeks seems optimistic, to say the least. Stoke, with six clean sheets in their last eight games, will be tricky opponents, but are coming off the back of a home defeat to Crystal Palace.

567	Swansea City	West Brom	1	0	26/12/2015	16	This has to go down as a must-win game for Swansea, who are still without a manager and have slipped into the bottom three on the back of one victory from their past 13 league matches. Sunday’s goalless draw with West Ham highlighted their biggest problem – a toothless attack. Tony Pulis’ team have failed to win in four and are without Salomón Rondón and James McClean, both of whom start three-match bans. Saido Berahino is set to start for the first time since October.

568	Tottenham Hotspur	Norwich City	3	0	26/12/2015	16	Norwich badly needed a win last week and they got one – perhaps somewhat surprisingly – at Old Trafford, a ground where they have not enjoyed a victory since August 1989. Tottenham should provide a sterner test than Louis van Gaal’s insipid Manchester United did and the fresh confidence of Alex Neil’s side will be tested. Harry Kane will be aiming to impress against the club where he spent an underwhelming loan spell in the 2012-13 season. Rich Flower	1	0.9815108478069305,0.9910693168640137
569	Arsenal	Newcastle United	1	0	02/01/2016	16	Arsenal will relish facing relegation contenders Newcastle to banish further the memory of that Boxing Day knockout delivered by Southampton. Arsenal have not lost at home since the season’s opening day and that, coupled with Arsène Wenger masterminding victories in his last eight encounters with Newcastle, makes it unlikely Steve McClaren will turn over a new leaf to begin 2016. Graham Searles	1	0.0323144793510437,0
570	Leicester City	Bournemouth	0	0	02/01/2016	16	This would probably have been billed as a relegation six-pointer at the start of the year. Jamie Vardy began his record-breaking run with a goal against Bournemouth, and will hope to add to his impressive tally. Claudio Ranieri’s side face a Bournemouth side who are in good form. Eddie Howe has coaxed the best out of his depleted squad, so could a shock be on the cards at the King Power? Martin White	0	0,0.9923583467801412
571	Manchester United	Swansea City	2	1	02/01/2016	16	The considerable constituency gunning for Louis van Gaal to be removed from his job were quietened following Manchester United’s goalless draw with Chelsea. Expect the snipers to start baying again should United lose to Swansea City at Old Trafford. Van Gaal is minded not to walk away but he knows a ninth match without a win will make life uncomfortable for him once more. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.9857856233914694,0
572	Norwich City	Southampton	1	0	02/01/2016	16	A good return in December has put a sliver of daylight between Norwich and the relegation places, and victory here would put them only one point behind a Southampton side whose momentum from thrashing Arsenal was halted at West Ham. Alex Neil is believed to be working on deals for Steven Naismith and the Dinamo Zagreb right-back Ivo Pinto; Norwich are certain to strengthen this month but will hope that Dieumerci Mbokani’s goal against Aston Villa on Tuesday marked the start of an overdue run of form for one of their existing front men. Nick Ames	1	0.9717447459697723,0
573	Sunderland	Aston Villa	3	1	02/01/2016	16	Aston Villa pose an excellent opportunity for Sunderland to return to winning ways after losing five successive games. Critically for Sunderland’s chances Villa will be without their solitary shining light this season, Jordan Ayew. However, Sunderland have absentees of their own at the back and could miss Sebastián Coates and John O’Shea, although that might be a blessing in disguise considering Sam Allardyce’s side have conceded a whopping 38 goals so far.

574	Watford	Manchester City	1	2	02/01/2016	16	Manchester City travel to Vicarage Road looking for their first away victory since Kelechi Iheanacho scored that late winner against Crystal Palace on 12 September. Manchester City’s goalless draw with Leicester City on Tuesday left them three points off the top and they cannot afford any complacency against Watford, who have taken four points off Chelsea and Liverpool in the past fortnight. With Vincent Kompany absent, Odion Ighalo will fancy his chances. The Watford striker has seven goals in his past six matches. Jacob Steinberg	-1	0.9959551095962524,0.34606873989105225
575	West Ham United	Liverpool	2	0	02/01/2016	16	West Ham’s 3-0 victory at Anfield in August spelt the beginning of the end for Brendan Rodgers and for his successor as Liverpool manager, Jürgen Klopp, the aim is to see his team record a third successive win at the start of a month the German has described as “crucial”. Both sides have injury headaches, although the hosts will be boosted by Dimitri Payet’s return to action. Sachin Nakrani	1	0.8367515206336975,0.9983764886856079
576	Crystal Palace	Chelsea	0	3	03/01/2016	16	Palace are chasing the league double over Chelsea, having won at Stamford Bridge last August – the first real shock of the José Mourinho implosion. And, as the form team, nobody would bet against them. Palace have lost only once in their previous nine games to sit fifth, although injuries and Yohan Cabaye’s ban stand to undermine them. Their compact and fast-breaking style will ask questions of Chelsea who welcome back Diego Costa from suspension. David Hytner	-1	0.0005417168140411377,0.9996637105941772
577	Everton	Tottenham Hotspur	1	1	03/01/2016	16	Everton will be keen to bounce back from Monday’s defeat by Stoke against Tottenham who are hoping to cement their place in the top four. Everton have a dreadful record against Spurs, winning none of their last six Premier League games against them. So, Romelu Lukaku’s blistering form will need to continue to give Everton a chance. Spurs will be looking to extend their winning run to four games for the first time since January 2014, but they will have to do it without Moussa Dembélé, who has been ruled out with a groin injury. Martin White	0	-0.32786786556243896,0.9864997863769531
578	Aston Villa	Leicester City	1	1	16/01/2016	16	Both achieved important 1-0 wins in midweek, albeit for very different reasons. Aston Villa very much remain in the mire, though, while Leicester, despite the goals drying up somewhat in recent weeks, have been tough to break down, keeping a clean sheet in their past three league outings. Villa led by two goals in the reverse fixture only to fall apart in the second half and concede three. Alan Smith	0	-0.8821055591106415,0
579	Bournemouth	Norwich City	3	0	16/01/2016	16	Two points separate Bournemouth and Norwich, who are both lingering above the bottom three. The hosts re-signed Lewis Grabban from Norwich on Monday, with the manager, Alex Neil, describing the striker as a worthless commodity. Grabban, who scored 35 goals in two seasons during his first spell at Bournemouth, will doubtless be keen to prove his worth again. Ben Fisher	1	0.940773626168569,-0.9993120431900024
580	Chelsea	Everton	3	3	16/01/2016	16	Chelsea remain unbeaten under Guus Hiddink but after being pegged back by West Brom on Wednesday are still only six points above the relegation places. Can Romelu Lukaku inflict more pain on his former club and earn Everton a first league win in four? The league’s joint top scorer failed to strike against Manchester City in midweek, but has 10 from his past 11 games. Alan Smith	0	-0.9416578412055969,-0.7754736542701721
581	Manchester City	Crystal Palace	4	0	16/01/2016	16	Although they could find no way past Everton in midweek, Manchester City have the division’s best home record. Crystal Palace might be short of goals and lost at Aston Villa on Tuesday but they have impressed more away from home than at Selhurst Park, thanks to blistering pace on the counter, meaning City will need to be at their sharpest to return to winning ways and maintain their title challenge. Alan Smith	1	0.9996132254600525,0.9973236322402954
582	Newcastle United	West Ham United	2	1	16/01/2016	16	The good news for Steve McClaren and Slaven Bilic is that the weather forecast suggests it will be dry so there should be no need for agonising over head coverings. The former England coach could do with building on Tuesday’s spirited draw against Manchester United by beating his one time Croatia counterpart but West Ham have their sights on Europe – and Dimitri Payet back in midfield. With Jonjo Shelvey likely to make his Newcastle debut in the same department an interesting subplot looms. Louise Taylor	1	0.9898554086685181,0.9931322336196899
583	Southampton	West Brom	3	0	16/01/2016	16	Southampton are feeling much better about themselves after beating Watford on Wednesday night and the visit of West Brom presents them with a good chance to win consecutive matches for the first time since early November. But West Brom should not be underestimated. Tony Pulis’s side are below Southampton only on goal difference and they were excellent in their 2-2 draw at Chelsea on Wednesday. Jacob Steinberg	1	0.9996412992477417,0.9765346050262451
584	Tottenham Hotspur	Sunderland	4	1	16/01/2016	16	Tottenham’s defeat to Leicester, conceding a late Robert Huth header, on Wednesday was a major blow to their title ambitions. They will be expected to return to winning ways here and strengthen their grip on a Champions League place against a side that were buoyed by winning at Swansea but remain beset by a shaky defence that has not kept a clean sheet since November. Alan Smith	1	-0.9984367489814758,-0.9957348704338074
585	Liverpool	Manchester United	0	1	17/01/2016	16	It does not help Richard Scudamore’s sales pitch to global broadcasters that a clash between the league’s biggest clubs is simply a contest between ninth and sixth in the table, but the significance of this game will not be lost on Jürgen Klopp and Louis van Gaal. Two very different managers want the same thing – evidence of genuine improvement – as they look to close the gap on the top four. Van Gaal has never lost to Liverpool and Klopp has never faced United before. League positions will be forgotten come kick-off. Andy Hunter	-1	0.01959383487701416,0
586	Stoke City	Arsenal	0	0	17/01/2016	16	Stoke have already taken the scalps of both Manchester clubs at home this season and, having beaten Arsenal last season, will relish the opportunity of checking another title hopeful. That 3-2 defeat for Arsène Wenger’s team was marked by some travelling supporters abusing their players at the train station afterwards. Defeat here, though, is no longer considered a disaster. Alan Smith	0	0.07860246300697327,-0.9963808655738831
587	Swansea City	Watford	1	0	18/01/2016	16	Swansea were justified to feel hard done by after suffering at the hands of awful refereeing in defeat to Sunderland midweek. Kyle Naughton’s suspension has been overturned, however, and is clear to play here against a side that has hit something of a slump recently, losing three and drawing one of their last four in the league. Watford did, however, win against Newcastle in the FA Cup. Alan Smith	1	-0.9964295029640198,0.9948723912239075
588	Crystal Palace	Tottenham Hotspur	1	3	23/01/2016	16	Crystal Palace are on a dire run of two points from their last five games, failing to score in all and shipping eight in the past three. Everything points to a Tottenham win, then. Mauricio Pochettino’s team came from behind to easily beat Sunderland last Saturday and also impressed in the FA Cup at Leicester. A Champions League spot is within their reach, but could they go all the way? Alan Smith	-1	-0.9995813965797424,0.9995999336242676
589	Leicester City	Stoke City	3	0	23/01/2016	16	Leicester have kept tabs with their title rivals despite a run of only one win from five but victory here is vital with games against Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal to follow. Claudio Ranieri says he is not worried about Jamie Vardy’s seven-match run without a goal, while Riyad Mahrez has also not found the net in five having also missed two penalties. Stoke will be tough to break down and rapid on the counter. Alan Smith	1	0.01477736234664917,-0.9811527729034424
590	Manchester United	Southampton	0	1	23/01/2016	16	Now is the time for Manchester United to embark on a winter-into-spring run to prove Louis van Gaal’s claim they can still seriously challenge for the title. Before them are a Southampton side who were beaten 3-2 in the reverse fixture and who have seven points fewer than United’s 37. Earlier this term Van Gaal’s men went 11 games unbeaten in all competitions of which only four were victories. The current sequence is five with three wins. This ratio has to continue into March at least. Jamie Jackson	-1	0.054561465978622437,-0.3128520647684733
591	Norwich City	Liverpool	4	5	23/01/2016	16	This is a happy hunting ground for Liverpool, winning their last four visits, and despite their erratic recent form should have enough to deepen Norwich’s woe. Consecutive defeats have left City two points above safety but those were both away. They are undefeated in five at Carrow Road. Alex Neil might give Steven Naismith his debut after the Scotland striker’s move from Everton was confirmed. Alan Smith	-1	0.011782616376876831,0.9992200136184692
592	Sunderland	Bournemouth	1	1	23/01/2016	16	Friends reunited is the subplot of a game Sam Allardyce says his Sunderland side simply cannot afford to lose. With the Wearsiders seemingly averse to drawing under Allardyce’s charge much may depend on the performances of two former Bournemouth loanees, Jermain Defoe and John O’Shea in the home ranks. Both played in the same south coast team as Eddie Howe and Jason Tindall, now the visiting manager and assistant manager. Defoe even lodged with Tindall with the then defender cooking for him.

593	Watford	Newcastle United	2	1	23/01/2016	16	Of their last nine league games Watford won the first four and lost the last four, with a draw in the middle. Their recent form means that for the first time since August there is some concern about their prospects this season, a wobble they will attempt to end by completing a treble over Newcastle, who have not lost in two matches since they were undeservedly beaten here in the FA Cup a fortnight ago. “It is a tough challenge to beat them again, but this is our target, to play well and replicate those good feelings,” said Quique Sánchez Flores. Watford’s record signing Nordin Amrabat should make his debut at some stage. Simon Burnton	1	0.4979555606842041,0.9346859455108643
594	West Brom	Aston Villa	0	0	23/01/2016	16	While Aston Villa’s performances have improved slightly in recent weeks, their form needs to get better quicker if they are to eat up the 10-point gap to safety. West Bromwich are safely positioned in mid-table and despite a host of injuries to key players, leaving Tony Pulis concerned, they will be fancied to complete a league double over their neighbours for the first time in 42 years. Alan Smith	0	0.9996775388717651,-0.9992415904998779
595	West Ham United	Manchester City	2	2	23/01/2016	16	West Ham can complete a first league double over Manchester City in 53 years and will fancy their chances given their run of one loss in nine games, albeit that being last week’s defeat at Newcastle. For City there is the opportunity to leapfrog Arsenal, and having tightened up at the back and containing Sergio Agüero in attack, the visitors will also feel confident of winning. Sachin Nakrani	0	0.9988032579421997,0.9997817873954773
596	Arsenal	Chelsea	0	1	24/01/2016	16	Arsène Wenger insists this is a derby against “direct rivals”, but there is little evidence to suggest last season’s champions will raise their game and disrupt the current leaders’ progress. Four of Chelsea’s six league wins this season have come against teams in the bottom eight, with the others against a Crystal Palace side on the turn and an Arsenal lineup reduced to nine men. That loss to José Mourinho in September will still rile Wenger, though the onus is now on Guus Hiddink to prove his unbeaten six-match tenure is no false dawn.

597	Everton	Swansea City	1	2	24/01/2016	16	Swansea won a game at long last in their previous outing against Watford, Everton dropped two points in a game they should have won by conceding in the 98th minute at Chelsea. The upshot is that the home side are still a point away from the top half of the table, the visitors just a point above the relegation positions. If new coach Francesco Guidolin is going to make a difference at the Welsh club, today would be a good time to start. Paul Wilson	-1	0,0.3293287555376689
598	Aston Villa	Norwich City	2	0	06/02/2016	16	If Aston Villa are to have just the slimmest chance of survival the visit of Norwich, who have lost five on the bounce, is a must-win game. However, injuries to Rudy Gestede and Libor Kozak have left Rémi Garde with just Gabriel Agbonlahor as his only fit striker. Norwich welcome Robbie Brady back as they look to end their dreadful run of losses and stay out of the relegation zone. Gregg Bakowski Kick-off Saturday 3pm	1	0.29165275891621906,0.9966580867767334
599	Liverpool	Sunderland	2	2	06/02/2016	16	Jürgen Klopp has a different problem in his attempt to keep supporters inside Anfield, with the fans’ group Spion Kop 1906 calling for a mass walkout in the 77th minute against Sunderland in protest at Liverpool’s new ticket price structure featuring £77 seats. On the pitch Liverpool need the cutting edge that was notable by its absence in the midweek defeat at Leicester City. Relegation-threatened Sunderland have not won at Anfield since October 1983. Andy Hunter	0	-0.9630211293697357,-0.9879639148712158
600	Manchester City	Leicester City	1	3	06/02/2016	16	Despite Leicester City arriving as leaders by three points the smart money remains on Manchester City beating them to close the deficit. But in this Premier League season for the ages anything is proving possible so imagine the boost for Jamie Vardy and company if they return back down the motorway having defeated Manuel Pellegrini’s men to double their advantage. Jamie Jackson	-1	0,0.35854804515838623
601	Newcastle United	West Brom	1	0	06/02/2016	16	What price for Saido Berahino stepping off the bench to score the winner for Tony Pulis’s side? Following West Brom’s rejection of Newcastle’s £21m bid for the forward, that is probably the stuff of Steve McClaren’s nightmares. If relegation is to be avoided – and if he is to keep his job – this really looks a must-win game for the Tynesiders. That task is complicated by an injury crisis. Despite investing £80m in new players this season, McClaren has only three fit senior defenders. Louise Taylor	1	0.9892070293426514,-0.9957802295684814
602	Southampton	West Ham United	1	0	06/02/2016	16	It will be worth keeping an eye on Charlie Austin as he makes his home debut for Southampton against the club that took a pass on him. Ronald Koeman’s side are in rich form and will hope Austin’s predatory skills help to close some of the gap to the team above them in sixth. West Ham are hard to beat, though, and have Andy Carroll available again after recovering from injury. Gregg Bakowski	1	0.996082603931427,0.7820084095001221
603	Stoke City	Everton	0	3	06/02/2016	16	Stoke City and Everton are both playing below par. Stoke have won once in the league in 2016 and have scored once in their past five matches, while Everton are 11th despite scoring more goals than everyone apart from the top three. Mark Hughes, who could start Stoke’s record signing Giannelli Imbula, needs his attack to click, Everton need their defence to cut out the errors. Jacob Steinberg	-1	-0.3323535720507304,0
604	Swansea City	Crystal Palace	1	1	06/02/2016	16	After such a bleak run, Swansea have picked up seven points from a possible nine to scramble clear of the bottom three and they badly need to continue that momentum against an out-of-form Crystal Palace. Alan Pardew’s team have dropped from fifth to 12th place after losing five league games on the spin and their long injury list now includes the names of James McArthur and Jason Puncheon. Alberto Paloschi looks sets to make his full debut for Swansea, who will be without Ki Sung-yueng. Stuart James	0	-0.00312119722366333,-0.9916983842849731
605	Tottenham Hotspur	Watford	1	0	06/02/2016	16	After four wins on the road, Tottenham return to White Hart Lane with optimism building. To sustain that they will need the new central defensive partnership of Kevin Wimmer and Toby Alderweireld to shut out Watford’s deadly duo of Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo. That is the stiffest test Spurs have faced since the loss of Jan Vertonghen to injury and if they pass it, especially if Dele Alli is unavailale through illness, then Premier League title talk will grow.

606	Bournemouth	Arsenal	0	2	07/02/2016	16	Arsenal are back in fourth. How did that happen? And they are well aware that they face a stern test at Dean Court. Bournemouth, who have been pepped up front by former Arsenal trainee Benik Afobe, have won five of their past 10 league games and Arsène Wenger is among those who are convinced that they will stay up. “They have enough substance in their game,” Wenger said. Arsenal must calm the jangling nerves. David Hytner	-1	0.9948391616344452,0.35898250341415405
607	Chelsea	Manchester United	1	1	07/02/2016	16	This is a tale of two seasoned Dutch managers who have not always seen eye to eye, but are now locked in a pursuit of Champions League football. Louis van Gaal can still aspire to achieve that via the domestic league. Guus Hiddink may have to target claiming a European Cup to leave his team competing for another. His side’s 10-match unbeaten run masks the reality they have yet to win a Premier League game at Stamford Bridge since he rejoined the club. This would be a fine moment to break that duck.

Eddie Howe, in contrast, has steered his side away from the relegation zone and a win here could edge them closer to mid-table and within two points of Mark Hughes’s side. Stoke’s wobbling resolve will be tested once more, while Benik Afobe is in search of his fourth Bournemouth goal in five matches. Ben Fisher	-1	0.9936444759368896,-0.9736861288547516
609	Chelsea	Newcastle United	5	1	13/02/2016	16	Guus Hiddink’s pursuit of a first home win in the Premier League since returning to Chelsea as interim manager will continue against Newcastle, a team who have lost their last five away games in all competitions stretching back two months. Yet the visitors have bolstered their ranks and will pose a different kind of threat at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea forever seem to be striving to salvage games. Unbeaten in 11, the hosts still need a win to look convincing before their midweek Champions League duel with Paris Saint-Germain. Dominic Fifield	1	0.9975724816322327,-0.9601873755455017
610	Crystal Palace	Watford	1	2	13/02/2016	16	At the end of December, these two teams looked as if they may be in contention for an unlikely push for Europe. But while Palace ended a run of five successive defeats last week with a point at Swansea, Watford have also stuttered having picked up only four points from their last six matches. Both sides will be therefore be desperate for a victory, although Palace’s need is probably greater. They will have to do it without Yannick Bolasie, who is due to return next week, while Watford will hope Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney can rediscover their scoring touches having failed to find the net in four of their last five matches.

611	Everton	West Brom	0	1	13/02/2016	16	Everton are once again moving in the right direction after recording successive league wins. West Brom, in stark contrast, are without a win in their last five in the league and there is serious danger that Tony Pulis’s side will become embroiled in the battle to avoid relegation. West Brom are still short of options in defence, with Gareth McAuley out with a hamstring problem. Everton, meanwhile, could hand a debut to attacker Oumar Niasse, a former Lokomotiv Moscow player known for his pace and power. Jeorge Bird	-1	0.9986419081687927,-0.9992216229438782
612	Norwich City	West Ham United	2	2	13/02/2016	16	Relegation is looking an increasingly likely prospect for Alex Neil’s Norwich. They take on an upwardly mobile West Ham side that will inevitably be buoyed by their dramatic FA Cup victory over Liverpool in midweek. To add to Norwich’s frustrations, midfielder Alex Tettey is suspended. However, West Ham have issues of their own to deal with as Cheikhou Kouyaté, Winston Reid and Joey O’Brien all miss out. The Norwich winger Matt Jarvis will hope for an opportunity to impress against his former side, with Neil’s side in need of attacking inspiration.

613	Sunderland	Manchester United	2	1	13/02/2016	16	If Louis van Gaal thinks he has got problems at Manchester United he should try swapping places with Sunderland’s Sam Allardyce. As if a relegation struggle was not bad enough, the Wearside club sacked Adam Johnson, their former England winger on Thursday night. Allardyce and Van Gaal failed to see eye to eye last season when the then West Ham manager left the Dutchman incensed after accusing Manchester United of “throwing long balls into the box” to secure a late 1-1 draw at Upton Park.

614	Swansea City	Southampton	0	1	13/02/2016	16	Fraser Forster has still to concede since being restored to the Saints goal and the team picked up 13 points in those five games while Swansea are finding some form themselves, undefeated in four, three of them under the new manager Francesco Guidolin. Ki Sung-yueng could return for them and the on-loan Leroy Fer is keen for a debut in front of his manager at Feyenoord, Ronald Koeman. Mark Tallentire	-1	0.9923704862594604,0.9973964691162109
615	Arsenal	Leicester City	2	1	14/02/2016	16	Can Le Professeur outsmart the self-titled Thinkerman again? Maybe, after all Arsène Wenger is the only manager so far to make Leicester look like the side that were bottom for much of last season. Arsenal, therefore, should be confident they can repeat the display and cut Leicester’s lead at the top in front of their own fans. However, Claudio Ranieri will surely be plotting another dazzling away win to keep his side on track for title glory. Graham Searles	1	0.9980505704879761,0.0010042190551757812
616	Aston Villa	Liverpool	0	6	14/02/2016	16	Rémi Garde’s team are showing signs of life at the bottom having lost one of their last five league games, although there were also signs of defensive vulnerability during last weekend’s win over Norwich City. With Philippe Coutinho, Daniel Sturridge and Divock Origi back from injury, Roberto Firmino scoring five goals in his last six outings and Christian Benteke anxious to face his former club, Jürgen Klopp finally has options to exploit Aston Villa’s weaknesses. But, as he admitted: “It is not a coincidence we are ninth and Villa are where they are.” Andy Hunter	-1	0.17747930685679117,0
617	Manchester City	Tottenham Hotspur	1	2	14/02/2016	16	A defeat for Manchester City by Tottenham Hotspur and victory for Leicester City at Arsenal earlier in the day would put Manuel Pellegrini’s side nine points behind the Foxes. This might not kill their title hopes but would certainly leave them moribund, so the solution is simple, though difficult to achieve: beat Mauricio Pochettino’s men. City’s ambitions should be boosted by Vincent Kompany’s return following a long-standing calf injury. Jamie Jackson	-1	0.18871071934700012,-0.9136732816696167
618	Leicester City	Norwich City	1	0	27/02/2016	16	Leicester City return to action refreshed after their late defeat at the hands of Arsenal and Claudio Ranieri will relish the prospect of hosting Norwich. Alex Neil’s side have conceded 18 and taken just one point from their past six games. Expecting victory should always be avoided but Ranieri can be sure Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy have the quality to maintain Leicester’s two-point advantage at the top.

619	Southampton	Chelsea	1	2	27/02/2016	16	Southampton have not conceded a goal in nine hours and 14 minutes of football, a daunting statistic for any side to tackle. However, if Chelsea can build on their impressive Cup demolition of Manchester City last Sunday then Guus Hiddink should expect a positive outcome. Ronald Koeman, meanwhile, will believe his compatriot is vulnerable and St Mary’s can witness a fifth straight home win. Graham Searles	-1	0.9962480068206787,0.9830077886581421
620	Stoke City	Aston Villa	2	1	27/02/2016	16	Hopes that Aston Villa may have belatedly been stirring to fight relegation seem to have been snuffed out by the 6-0 drubbing by Liverpool a fortnight ago. Rémi Garde has Rudy Gestede and Gabriel Agbonlahor fit again but an ailing defence will be tested by a Stoke side that, bolstered by new arrival Giannelli Imbula, looked to have recovered their potency in the win at Bournemouth.

621	Watford	Bournemouth	0	0	27/02/2016	16	Watford and Bournemouth both sit above the relegation places, a pleasing sight for a promoted manager. Quique Sánchez Flores will be the happier of the two, though, as his side close in on securing top-flight status – if they win on Saturday, they will have 39 points. Meanwhile, Eddie Howe needs to spark Bournemouth into life after three successive defeats, the most recent in the FA Cup. Graham Searles	0	0.9985582232475281,-0.994637668132782
622	West Brom	Crystal Palace	3	2	27/02/2016	16	Separated by goal difference, neither are safe from a relegation fight just yet. West Brom’s restorative win at Everton before the FA Cup shenanigans at Reading was a big boost for Tony Pulis’s team, while Palace’s league form has been diabolical. They have not won since the turn of the year, losing six of their last nine. But can they build on their Cup win at Tottenham? Alan Smith	1	0.999508261680603,-0.9844042658805847
623	West Ham United	Sunderland	1	0	27/02/2016	16	Sam Allardyce’s return to Upton Park provides the human interest but the warmth of reception he receives will not change the stakes being fought for. West Ham have a habit of dropping points when the Champions League places move into view but victory here might exert some pressure on those above; Allardyce’s Sunderland, on the other hand can take encouragement from an improved run of February performances and the manager’s face will be a picture if his side have earned three vital points to aid their relegation fight. Nick Ames	1	0.960448682308197,0
624	Tottenham Hotspur	Swansea City	2	1	28/02/2016	16	Francesco Guidolin has been under the weather during the week and it is tempting, although incorrect, to link the Swansea City manager’s queasiness to this fixture. Tottenham slipped up last weekend in the FA Cup against Crystal Palace but they are in a rare grove while Swansea have found goals hard to come by and they remain perched above the relegation places. Under Guidolin, they have stabilised but title-chasing Tottenham are determined to make no mistakes. David Hytner	1	0.9855340719223022,0.9776690602302551
625	Manchester United	Arsenal	3	2	28/02/2016	16	Manchester United have the chance to win three consecutive games for the first time since November by beating Arsenal. The feat would mark an excellent seven days for Louis van Gaal. Arsène Wenger’s side have lost and drawn their past two matches but neither of these were in the league, and given Arsenal are two points behind Leicester City after beating them before the FA Cup round, victory is necessary to continue their push for title glory.

626	Chelsea	Stoke City	1	1	05/03/2016	16	The last time these sides met Chelsea were in crisis and their manager was banned from the stadium. How times change. The London club are now in excellent form and the man in charge, Guus Hiddink, can do no wrong. Stoke will prove a stern test, however, and should sense they can win at Stamford Bridge for the first time since 1974, especially as John Terry remains out injured.

627	Everton	West Ham United	2	3	05/03/2016	16	Slaven Bilic admitted on Friday that a top-four finish for his West Ham side “is realistic now. We are one point behind with 10 games to go so we have a chance”. Everton, eight points further back, have no such hope and it will take a flourish over the final few months for this not to be regarded as a season of underachievement. The new investment at Goodison brings extra pressure. John Ashdown	-1	-0.05735582113265991,0.9990968704223633
628	Manchester City	Aston Villa	4	0	05/03/2016	16	Manchester City have the perfect opportunity to bounce back from their rather embarrassing 3-0 defeat to Liverpool on Wednesday. If Manuel Pellegrini cannot rouse City to beat Aston Villa then hopes of winning the title will surely be all but lost. Rémi Garde, meanwhile, could be forgiven for dreading his side’s visit to the Etihad and the proposition of being cut further adrift at the foot of the table.

629	Newcastle United	Bournemouth	1	3	05/03/2016	16	There are many who feel the endgame is under way for Steve McClaren at Newcastle. Some suspect this may be his last stand as manager but he remains optimistic he can confound the doubters by leading his team out of the bottom three. Bournemouth, though, will be anxious to exert revenge for a slightly flukey Newcastle win on the south coast earlier in the season. Fabricio Coloccini is still injured, so Jonjo Shelvey continues as the home captain with his manager hoping the England midfielder can bring much needed “edge” to the role.

630	Southampton	Sunderland	1	1	05/03/2016	16	Hovering just above the relegation zone with just one win in seven, the omens don’t bode well for Sunderland as they make the long trip to Southampton, where they were thrashed 8-0 last season. They have won just two games on the road in this campaign and will be without midfield enforcer Lee Cattermole through a concussion. Ronald Koeman will miss his hamstrung striker Charlie Austin, while Shane Long must also sit this one out. Barry Glendenning	0	-0.9977589845657349,-0.9911312460899353
631	Swansea City	Norwich City	1	0	05/03/2016	16	After fielding a weakened side against Arsenal, which showed Swansea City were focusing on hosting Norwich City, they will be delighted with pulling off a huge upset at the Emirates on Wednesday. Francesco Guidolin will not be present on the touchline again but his side should be very confident they can inflict another defeat on struggling Norwich. Alex Neil needs three points urgently to allay fears of Championship football next season. Graham Searles	1	0.9995908141136169,0.000312119722366333
632	Tottenham Hotspur	Arsenal	2	2	05/03/2016	16	This is a biggie. In fact, this is the biggest north London derby in recent memory. As Arsène Wenger remarked, never before in his 19 and a half years at Arsenal has this showdown stood to shape the title race. Tottenham slipped up at West Ham in midweek but their belief is strong and they are favourites. Arsenal’s form has deserted them and another defeat does not bear thinking about for Wenger. David Hytner	0	0.9983470439910889,0.3325773278872172
633	Watford	Leicester City	0	1	05/03/2016	16	West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster denied Leicester maximum points in midweek, and Watford’s Heurelho Gomes will be keen to keep Claudio Ranieri’s side at bay too, as he made a costly mistake to gift Leicester with victory at the King Power Stadium in November. The Brazilian goalkeeper will have to excel if the hosts are to disrupt Leicester’s progress towards the title, especially if Odion Ighalo’s six-game goal drought continues. Paul Doyle	-1	0,-0.002911090850830078
634	Crystal Palace	Liverpool	1	2	06/03/2016	16	Victory over Manchester City in midweek gave Jürgen Klopp a much-needed boost after defeat in the Capital One Cup final, but inconsistency has stalked his Liverpool side thus far. They have not beaten Palace in the league at Selhurst since 1997 but the Eagles are in freefall. Had the Premier League season begun on New Year’s Day Alan Pardew’s side would be bottom of the table.

635	West Brom	Manchester United	1	0	06/03/2016	16	Given this season of high unpredictability Manchester United still have an outside chance of claiming the title. They are 10 points behind Leicester City as West Brom welcome them, having won their past three matches. Tony Pulis’s side held Claudio Ranieri’s leaders to a draw on Tuesday and will be a tough proposition for Louis van Gaal’s side. This may end in a draw.

636	Bournemouth	Swansea City	3	2	12/03/2016	16	Only a few weeks ago, this match would have felt hugely important in the race for Premier League survival. It still might be but Bournemouth have taken an impressive haul of seven points from their last three matches while Swansea have won their last two. Swansea will still be without head coach Francesco Guidolin, who continues to recover from a chest infection. First-team coach Alan Curtis will again deputise in the dugout.

637	Norwich City	Manchester City	0	0	12/03/2016	16	It seems implausible that, despite taking one point from their past nine games, Norwich City are only a win from 17th place. Victory cannot be delayed much longer though and Alex Neil’s side might not wish to dwell on the fact that their woeful league run was prefaced, back in January, by a 3-0 FA Cup defeat at Carrow Road to Manchester City. Victory for the away side would apply a degree of pressure on the title chasers above them, and this looks like a game neither team can really afford to lose. Nick Ames	0	-0.999396800994873,0
638	Stoke City	Southampton	1	2	12/03/2016	16	Stoke, who have taken 10 points from their past four matches and after securing an impressive 1-1 draw with Chelsea last time out, appear to be in a rich vein of form. So Mark Hughes will welcome Southampton to the Britannia as he endeavours to better last season’s record 54-point haul. Ronald Koeman can only hope his defence remains resolute and that Graziano Pellè finally finds the net once more as the Italian’s goal drought stretches back to the beginning of November.

639	Aston Villa	Tottenham Hotspur	0	2	13/03/2016	16	Mauricio Pochettino made it clear with his weakened team selection in Thursday’s 3-0 defeat against Borussia Dortmund that the Premier League is his priority this season. Aston Villa should, on the face of it, be obliging opponents for Spurs and it is tempting to wonder if Pochettino could have rested players for this fixture, against the Premier League’s bottom club, and picked a stronger side in Dortmund. Either way Spurs need to get back on track after winning only two of their last seven in all competitions. Stuart James	-1	0.8942074179649353,-0.00032207369804382324
640	Leicester City	Newcastle United	1	0	14/03/2016	16	Rafa Benítez has the unenviable task of taking charge of Newcastle United against league leaders, Leicester City. That said, expectations will be low on Tyneside, so an unlikely positive result could prove hugely beneficial to Newcastle’s hopes of staying in the Premier League. Claudio Ranieri, meanwhile, will see victory as a must as their closest threat, Tottenham, should earn three points against Aston Villa. Graham Searles	1	0.9989873766899109,0.9784685373306274
641	Chelsea	West Ham United	2	2	19/03/2016	16	Slaven Bilic has warned his players not to take Chelsea lightly, even though the champions seemingly have nothing to play for after going out of the Champions League and the FA Cup. Chelsea are nine points behind West Ham United, who are two points off the top four, and have a selection headache with Diego Costa suspended. Nonetheless, Bilic is wary of their threat and West Ham will need to be at their best to win at Stamford Bridge for the first time since 2002.

642	Crystal Palace	Leicester City	0	1	19/03/2016	16	Selhurst Park has been a graveyard for prospective Premier League champions in the past and despite Palace’s failure to record a league win so far in 2016, Leicester City will be wary of their trip to south London. Alan Pardew’s side have belied their struggles to reach the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 21 years and, with Yannick Bolasie back on form, Palace could be a potential banana skin for the Foxes. Claudio Ranieri had a sausage, of all things, named after him this week by a local butcher but the Leicester manager knows this is no time to take anything for granted.

643	Everton	Arsenal	0	2	19/03/2016	16	It might be cynical to suggest Arsenal have commenced their annual reverse into fourth place but, despite Roberto Martínez’s claims that his opponents remain strong title contenders, a run of one win in eight games in all competitions has presented an all too familiar problem for Arsène Wenger. At least they will not be facing Messi, Suárez, Neymar and co when they arrive at Everton, who have won only one of the past 17 league meetings between the sides and lost seven times already at home in the Premier League this season. Andy Hunter	-1	-0.9075723886489868,-0.997018575668335
644	Swansea City	Aston Villa	1	0	19/03/2016	16	It is easy to see why Francesco Guidolin has described this fixture as the “most important game of the season” for Swansea City. Another three points will take the Welsh club to 36 and surely put any lingering relegation fears to bed. André Ayew is sidelined with an ankle injury but Gylfi Sigurdsson is in fine form and Swansea will be confident of picking up a third win in four matches. As for Aston Villa, they have lost their last five and need a minor miracle. Stuart James	1	0.9957326054573059,-0.9912619590759277
645	Watford	Stoke City	1	2	19/03/2016	16	Watford capped a great season back in the top flight last weekend, as they secured their passage into the FA Cup semi-finals against Arsenal. Quique Sánchez Flores’s side will now look to turn around their league form having only won one of their last six. Stoke City travel to Vicarage Road having lost for the first time in five games last week against Southampton and Mark Hughes will know returning to winnings ways will be tough against Watford’s staunch defence. Simon Hahn	-1	0.27489684025446576,-0.9775915145874023
646	West Brom	Norwich City	0	1	19/03/2016	16	West Brom are one of the form teams in the Premier League having picked up 10 points from their past four games including a 1-0 win over Manchester United two weeks ago. The run has moved them away from danger at the bottom, whereas Norwich City are still deep in trouble. Despite an improved showing against Manchester City last week, Alex Neil’s side have not won since 2 January and are still among the relegation favourites.

647	Manchester City	Manchester United	0	1	20/03/2016	16	Manchester City can all but kill off Manchester United’s Champions League qualification hopes by winning the 171st derby. This would also boost their bid to ensure a top-four finish and overhaul the faltering Arsenal, who are third. After United’s exit from the Europa League at Liverpool’s hands, Louis van Gaal could do without a defeat and as this is the story of his season, expect little to change regarding his employment.

648	Newcastle United	Sunderland	1	1	20/03/2016	16	Possibly the most important north-east derby to date features two managers with a history of conflict effectively on missions to relegate each other. If the Big Sam-Rafa technical subplot promises edginess, Rafael Benítez is more concerned with marking his first home game in charge of Newcastle by ending Sunderland’s run of six straight derby wins. By peculiar coincidence, four of those victories saw Sunderland under the charge of a new manager presiding over his second game after losing the first. Can Benítez emulate Paolo Di Canio, Gus Poyet, Dick Advocaat and Allardyce? Louise Taylor	0	0.9929592609405518,0.998706042766571
649	Southampton	Liverpool	3	2	20/03/2016	16	A repeat of the 6-1 victory that Liverpool enjoyed at St Mary’s in the Capital One Cup in December would be welcome for Jürgen Klopp’s team, who remain within striking distance of the top four. But Southampton have tightened up since then and, with Graziano Pellè back on the goal trail and Sadio Mané having had his red card rescinded, they have the firepower to pursue their own European ambitions. All is set for a high-stakes, high-quality duel. Paul Doyle	1	0.9996364116668701,0.9995529055595398
650	Tottenham Hotspur	Bournemouth	3	0	20/03/2016	16	Tottenham Hotspur can now focus solely on their pursuit of a first league title in 55 years with their involvement in Europe curtailed in midweek, though Bournemouth will hardly be pushovers at White Hart Lane. Eddie Howe’s side are mid-table, virtually safe, unbeaten away from home in 2016 and have won their last three matches. The hosts will restore Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen, Mousa Dembélé and their full-back pairing and hope they hit the ground running. Last Sunday’s win at Villa Park has eased a few nerves, but now is the time for Mauricio Pochettino’s side to generate real momentum. Dominic Fifield	1	0.8875520428021749,0.9879824221134186
651	Arsenal	Watford	4	0	02/04/2016	16	Watford are enjoying a great season under Quique Sánchez Flores, but with one point from their last four league games they still have to be careful. Arsenal need victory to stay in the top four – and to keep any possible title hopes alive. These sides met at the Emirates only three weeks ago in the FA Cup, when Watford worked incredibly hard to knock out an Arsenal side that looked far too complacent on the day.

652	Aston Villa	Chelsea	0	4	02/04/2016	16	Does anyone still believe Aston Villa are capable of producing a miracle? No. They are 12 points adrift of safety with seven games to go but have long looked resigned to relegation. It makes this early kick-off something of a nothing game. Chelsea have a nine-point gap to sixth, perhaps making it an ideal time for Guus Hiddink to give a portion of the club’s youngsters some minutes. Alan Smith	-1	-0.985680878162384,0.9887663722038269
653	Bournemouth	Manchester City	0	4	02/04/2016	16	Manuel Pellegrini’s Manchester City travel to the south coast in search of their first win in four matches. After losing to Manchester United before the international break, City’s hopes of securing a top-four finish suddenly look precarious, with in-form West Ham United breathing down their necks. Bournemouth travelled to Dubai for a five-day training camp over the international break and Eddie Howe is keen for the home side to perform after a 5-1 defeat at the Etihad in October. “It’s not one we just want to host and put on a show for them, we want to give them a really good game,” said Howe.

654	Liverpool	Tottenham Hotspur	1	1	02/04/2016	16	Liverpool have not cast off their maddening inconsistency, as confirmed inside 90 minutes at Southampton, but a trip to Anfield represents a fundamental test of Tottenham’s title credentials regardless. The visitors have won only one of their last 21 league trips to Liverpool and have collected nine points from the last 63 available at Anfield. But with Harry Kane one goal short of a Premier League record for Spurs and Dele Alli confronting the club that neglected to sign him, Mauricio Pochettino has the talent to make a significant statement of intent.

655	Norwich City	Newcastle United	3	2	02/04/2016	16	Defeat would leave both of these sides even deeper in relegation trouble so the first test at Carrow Road will be to conquer nerves. That will be particularly true for the goalkeeper – probably Karl Darlow – drafted into the Newcastle line-up to replace the injured Rob Elliot. None of Norwich’s strikers have scored regularly this season but whichever of them is deployed by Alex Neil is sure to be instructed to put as much pressure as possible on the inexperienced stand-in.

656	Stoke City	Swansea City	2	2	02/04/2016	16	Stoke City and Swansea City have been playing well of late and both need another victory, for different reasons. The Swans need the points to get safe from relegation while Stoke are still hoping for Europa League qualification. In their last four meetings at the Britannia Stadium, Stoke have won three. Despite losing Jack Butland for the season, Mark Hughes will be hoping Marko Arnautovic, a scorer in their past three home games, can be the difference again.

657	Sunderland	West Brom	0	0	02/04/2016	16	A run of 17 games without a clean sheet has undermined the improvements implemented by Sam Allardyce at Sunderland. “It means we need to score twice to stand a chance of winning,” said Allardyce who will aim to put such defensive shortcomings right at the expense of his friend Tony Pulis in what threatens to prove a less than expansive contest. While West Brom enjoy the luxury of mid-table security, anything less than victory will escalate Wearside relegation concerns. Louise Taylor	0	-0.9993457198143005,-0.9976547956466675
658	West Ham United	Crystal Palace	2	2	02/04/2016	16	Alan Pardew returns to a former club in desperate need of points. Crystal Palace were fifth on New Year’s Eve but 13 games without a league win have transformed them into unlikely relegation candidates. Yet although they have won each of their past two visits to Upton Park, Palace are sure to find it tough against Slaven Bilic’s West Ham United, who have their eyes on the Champions League.

Certainly, even a home game against a fine Southampton side will feel like an opportunity and, for once, the hosts must perform after Tottenham Hotspur’s daunting trip to Anfield. The likes of Jamie Vardy, Danny Drinkwater and N’Golo Kanté will have returned to the King Power Stadium buoyed by their impact over the international break.

660	Manchester United	Everton	1	0	03/04/2016	16	After the exhilaration of the 1-0 derby win at Manchester City, Manchester United have eight league matches to move up from sixth to fourth place and thus qualify for the Champions League. Everton were downed 3-0 at Goodison Park in October’s reverse fixture and Louis van Gaal said it was a complete display. How Van Gaal would love a repeat over a Roberto Martínez side whose 38 points is a poor yield given their array of stellar talents, led by Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley.

661	Aston Villa	Bournemouth	1	2	09/04/2016	16	It may seem incredible but Aston Villa are bidding to complete a league double over Bournemouth, after securing their only away win against Eddie Howe’s side on the opening day of the season. Since then Villa have crumbled, sacking Tim Sherwood and Rémi Garde. All hopes of avoiding relegation are more mathematical than plausible now and the drop could be confirmed on Saturday. Graham Searles	-1	-0.0006427168846130371,0
662	Crystal Palace	Norwich City	1	0	09/04/2016	16	For most clubs tantalisingly in touch of safety, successive home games against Norwich City and Everton would represent an opportunity. After all, Alex Neil’s side are one of the few teams below Crystal Palace, while Everton’s focus is purely on an FA Cup semi-final to come. Yet Alan Pardew’s side have lost their last six matches at Selhurst Park and Norwich are in their best form of the season and threatening to break free of the condemned. Pardew has called for a raucous atmosphere but this pocket of south London may be gripped by nerves. Dominic Fifield	1	-0.3837115367253621,0.9989608526229858
663	Manchester City	West Brom	2	1	09/04/2016	16	As they welcome West Brom, Manuel Pellegrini’s side should be buzzing after the 2-2 draw at PSG in Wednesday’s Champions League quarter-final first leg. This bounce may be required to dismantle a Tony Pulis side that could feature a four-man defence of centre-backs, as is the manager’s penchant. This was what Manchester United faced when they lost at The Hawthorns last month and, as Louis van Gaal’s side are at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, here is a chance to open up a four-point lead over United in the race for a Champions League berth. Jamie Jackson	1	0,0.3595788876215617
664	Southampton	Newcastle United	3	1	09/04/2016	16	The Rafa Benítez effect has yet to take hold at Newcastle and the manager and club are running out of time and matches. If they are to make a late dash out of the relegation zone, they could do with getting their first away point – or three – of the year at St Mary’s. Aleksandar Mitrovic made a strong case for a starting spot, scoring twice at Norwich last week after coming off the bench, but Southampton’s central defenders are capable of stifling the Serb’s aerial ability and the hosts will fancy their chances of winning to reassert their push for European qualification.

665	Swansea City	Chelsea	1	0	09/04/2016	16	Chelsea have never drawn blank against Swansea in the Premier League and combined with the fact that Guus Hiddink is yet to lose a league game since returning, the omens are not brilliant for Francesco Guidolin. However, Gylfi Sigurdsson’s three goals in his last four games have lifted Swansea from imminent danger and the Icelander’s semblance of his former brilliance could upset the odds.

666	Watford	Everton	1	1	09/04/2016	16	Roberto Martínez will be perturbed by Everton’s run of three successive league defeats. However, the Spaniard will see Watford, who are on an even worse run of four defeats, as a golden opportunity to gain momentum ahead of their season-defining FA Cup semi-final. Quique Sánchez Flores will feel exactly the same as Watford have a semi-final of their own to contend against Crystal Palace. Graham Searles	0	0.8971894780794779,-0.6936708688735962
667	West Ham United	Arsenal	3	3	09/04/2016	16	West Ham began their season with a 2-0 victory at the Emirates Stadium and their chances of finishing in the top four could rest on completing their first league double over Arsenal since the 2006-07 season. Yet Arsenal are in good form, thrashing Everton and Watford in their previous two matches, and victory at Upton Park would keep their title hopes alive.

668	Liverpool	Stoke City	4	1	10/04/2016	16	Jürgen Klopp’s team are eyeing European qualification through the glorified route of winning the Europa League but both sides will be looking to enhance their claims via the Premier League at Anfield. Liverpool and Stoke City have met three times this season with the away team winning 1-0 on each occasion, although disappointingly for Mark Hughes that was not enough to take his side into the Capital One Cup final on their last visit to Anfield. Liverpool’s options are stretched in central midfield with Jordan Henderson injured and Emre Can commencing a two-match suspension. Andy Hunter	1	-0.011082351207733154,0
669	Sunderland	Leicester City	0	2	10/04/2016	16	Jan Kirchhoff and Yann M’Vila take on N’Golo Kanté and Danny Drinkwater in an intriguing meeting between two formidably strong central midfield departments as two teams with broadly similar playing philosophies lock horns. Jermain Defoe will hope to upstage Jamie Vardy on a day when Sunderland aim to prove they are not quite as bad as their position, third bottom in the table, suggests. Sam Allardyce’s problem is that Leicester will want to remind everyone – Tottenham particularly – why they would make worthy champions. Louise Taylor	-1	-0.8481724858283997,0.0031071901321411133
670	Tottenham Hotspur	Manchester United	3	0	10/04/2016	16	If the title is not going to end up with Claudio Ranieri and Leicester, Tottenham need to win here. Kyle Walker’s own goal gave United three points and a flying start to the season in August, but since then Tottenham have improved in all areas. United haven’t lost at White Hart Lane in any of their last 14 league encounters, and have two successive clean sheets behind them. Joel Tivemo	1	0.0690746009349823,0.999367892742157
671	Chelsea	Manchester City	0	3	16/04/2016	16	Eyebrows would have been raised if you said these two would be long ruled out of title contention by mid-April before this most unpredictable of seasons began, but this will at least be a tad more competitive than City’s last visit to Stamford Bridge, where Manuel Pellegrini’s protest team were skewered 5-1 in the FA Cup. They could do with a win to help their top-four case. Alan Smith	-1	0,0.9692015647888184
672	Everton	Southampton	1	1	16/04/2016	16	Europe remains an incentive for Ronald Koeman with his team just two points off qualification for the Europa League but for Roberto Martínez the pressure is much closer to home. Eight home league defeats are the principal reason for mounting criticism of the Everton manager, who has a Merseyside derby and FA Cup semi-final next week and may protect such leading players as Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley from minor knocks as a consequence. Andy Hunter	0	-0.8206437528133392,0
673	Manchester United	Aston Villa	1	0	16/04/2016	16	Wayne Rooney will expect to be named in the Manchester United starting XI for the first time since injuring a knee on 13 February in the 2-1 defeat at Sunderland. If he does not, expect a prolonged inquest into why. Especially as Aston Villa could be relegated at the final whistle, so are ideal opponents for the captain to ease his way back into the fray from the start.

674	Newcastle United	Swansea City	3	0	16/04/2016	16	Rafael Benítez celebrates his 56th birthday on Saturday but he will only be smiling if he secures his first win as manager of Newcastle United. Should Benitez’s players suffer another stumble survival will, realistically, be near impossible so the Spaniard could do with a strong performance from Jonjo Shelvey against his former employers. He must also cope without Daryl Janmaat, his Holland right back, who has undergone hand surgery after punching a dressing room wall in frustration during last Saturday’s defeat at frustration. Tynesiders can only pray Swansea’s Gylfi Sigurdsson’s recent stellar form deserts him. Louise Taylor	1	0.9662497937679291,-0.998753547668457
675	Norwich City	Sunderland	0	3	16/04/2016	16	This is the type of game the phrase six-pointer was created for but the Friendship Trophy is more important for Sunderland, who would pull within a point of Norwich with victory. A win for Alex Neil’s team will give them at least a six-point cushion from the relegation zone – possibly more depending on events at St James’ Park – with four games to go. Newcastle, for once, will be hoping their local rivals win. Alan Smith	-1	0.9966806769371033,0.9896093904972076
676	West Brom	Watford	0	1	16/04/2016	16	What odds this battle of 14th versus 15th and joint-lowest scorers in the division being last on Match of the Day? Albion have the worst shots-on-target average in the country, while Watford are on a stinking run of form (losing four of their last five) and might have an eye on next weekend’s FA Cup semi-final. The reverse fixture, predictably, ended scoreless. Alan Smith	-1	-0.9996578693389893,0
677	Arsenal	Crystal Palace	1	1	17/04/2016	16	Arsenal have reached the point where they need a near-miracle for a title win and it feels like the imperative now is to button down a Champions League finish and, ideally, reel in Tottenham Hotspur. Their run-in looks favourable and they do have a cushion over fifth-placed Manchester United. Arsène Wenger merely wants victories over teams that Arsenal should be beating, and prayers to be answered. Crystal Palace have an FA Cup semi-final next Sunday. Has this been mentioned at all? David Hytner	0	-0.8086807131767273,0.988584041595459
678	Bournemouth	Liverpool	1	2	17/04/2016	16	How much energy will Liverpool have after Thursday night’s heroic comeback against Borussia Dortmund? A trip to face Eddie Howe’s high-energy Bournemouth, who could remarkably finish in the top half in their debut top-flight season, is sure to be testing. The hosts will be without influential midfielder Harry Arter, though, who has an ankle injury that might rule him out of Euro 2016. Alan Smith	-1	0.0001590251922607422,0.9908711314201355
679	Leicester City	West Ham United	2	2	17/04/2016	16	Five games to go. Leicester can afford to slip up in two of them and still win their first title but on current form it looks like they might secure the trophy with time to spare. Victory against West Ham, likely still hurting from their FA Cup exit to Manchester United in midweek, would see Claudio Ranieri’s team 10 points clear of Tottenham before the Londoners play Stoke on Monday. This fixture last season was the moment Leicester started their recovery, winning 2-1. Alan Smith	0	0.9963063895702362,0.9878376722335815
680	Stoke City	Tottenham Hotspur	0	4	18/04/2016	16	By kick-off at the Britannia on Monday evening, Tottenham could be 10 points behind Leicester with five games to play. They should, however, have enough to beat Stoke, who remain saddled with selection problems in defence and have won only once in their last five outings. Jakob Haugaard has been unconvincing in goal so Stoke’s Irish veteran Shay Given could be brought in. Alan Smith	-1	-0.77457195520401,0.9703866243362427
681	Aston Villa	Southampton	2	4	23/04/2016	16	The departures of David Bernstein and Mervyn King from the board and the suspensions of Gabriel Agbonlahor and Jores Okore made it another dire week for Aston Villa in an already dreadful season. Things are unlikely to improve on Saturday with Southampton needing a win to keep their European hopes alive. Already relegated after nine defeats in a row, the only thing the Villa squad have left to play for is pride – but will they show any? Rich Flower	-1	-0.9117623567581177,-0.984557032585144
682	Bournemouth	Chelsea	1	4	23/04/2016	16	Bournemouth’s victory over Chelsea in December was the penultimate league match of José Mourinho’s second tenure at Stamford Bridge and, when Glenn Murray struck late on, it ensured the champions remained mired in the bottom reaches of the table. Now Chelsea are three points clear of Eddie Howe’s side as the campaign draws to a close, but it is clear which club has enjoyed the better season. James Riach	-1	0.959726870059967,0.999196469783783
683	Liverpool	Newcastle United	2	2	23/04/2016	16	Rafael Benítez’s return to Anfield as the interim manager of Chelsea in 2013 was overshadowed somewhat by Luis Suárez’s bite on Branislav Ivanovic. He heads back seeking a favour from his old club in his attempt to keep Newcastle in the Premier League, but Liverpool are not in the form to give one – regardless of what team Jürgen Klopp selects. With Villarreal in the Europa League semi-finals to come next week, Klopp may revert to the much-changed lineup that beat Bournemouth last Sunday.

684	Manchester City	Stoke City	4	0	23/04/2016	16	As is the tale of their season, Manchester City were flying on arrival at Newcastle United on Wednesday night but stumbled surprisingly and could only draw against the relegation-threatened side. Now Stoke City must be beaten or Manchester United could overhaul Manuel Pellegrini’s side in the chase for a Champions League place. The visitors will need no reminding of how they dismantled City 2-0 in early December so this will be an intriguing watch. Jamie Jackson	1	0.014453232288360596,-0.957821249961853
685	Leicester City	Swansea City	4	0	24/04/2016	16	While few could deny that the suspension of Jamie Vardy is a significant blow to Leicester’s title aspirations, Claudio Ranieri’s side coped when he went five games without scoring in February and March – they won four and drew one. Swansea, who have nothing to play for and have won away only three times all season, should be pushovers for the hosts but the pressure of leading the pack can have a funny effect – just ask Kevin Keegan.

686	Sunderland	Arsenal	0	0	24/04/2016	16	The mutual antipathy between Sam Allardyce and Arsène Wenger may have diminished to the point where it has almost been consigned to history but the pair’s more mellow relationship does not mean they have lost their competitive edge. And especially not when so much is at stake. While a win would enhance Sunderland’s survival chances considerably, Wenger’s need to make certain of Champions League qualification – while keeping those critics calling for his summer-time replacement at bay – should ensure a certain spice.

687	Arsenal	Norwich City	1	0	30/04/2016	16	This one means everything for Norwich and a positive result would do wonders in their battle to avoid relegation. Arsène Wenger would simply sign up for some positivity. Although Arsenal have not yet confirmed their top four place – there remains work to be done – the bigger picture at the Emirates takes in the acute fan frustration. Wenger’s defiance and stubbornness are enduring. David Hytner	1	0.2931270996729533,0.9997313618659973
688	Everton	Bournemouth	2	1	30/04/2016	16	Everton face Bournemouth under pressure amid reports that fans will stage protests against Roberto Martínez. With several key defenders injured or suspended the chance of them extending their poor defensive record at Goodison is likely. Youngsters Matthew Pennington and Kieran Dowell may be handed their league debuts. Max Gradel could return for Bournemouth whose only win in their past five games came at relegated Aston Villa. Eddie Howe might see the game as an audition to replace Martínez as he is currently third favourite with bookies, behind Manuel Pellegrini and David Moyes, to do so.

689	Newcastle United	Crystal Palace	1	0	30/04/2016	16	Alan Pardew returns to the club where mention of his name still polarises opinion, in charge of a Palace side who may have reached the FA Cup final but remain on a shocking league run. They do though possess Yohan Cabaye, and Rafa Benítez will be anxious to stop Tyneside’s one-time favourite midfielder reminding the club what they are missing. Cabaye needs to be kept quiet if Newcastle are to secure the victory they so desperately need. Louise Taylor	1	-0.9964162111282349,0.9858594834804535
690	Stoke City	Sunderland	1	1	30/04/2016	16	With Sam Allardyce concerned that Crystal Palace are going to experience an FA Cup hangover against Newcastle United, there is increased pressure on Sunderland on Saturday. The good news for them is that Stoke City have lost their past three matches, conceding 12 goals in the process – and Sunderland need to turn draws into wins if they are going to stay up. Jacob Steinberg	0	0,-0.09712794423103333
691	Watford	Aston Villa	3	2	30/04/2016	16	Aston Villa’s relegation was the worst kept secret in football until it was mercifully confirmed a couple of weeks ago. The real subplot surrounding this fixture is the future of Quique Sánchez Flores. The Spaniard guided Watford to an FA Cup semi-final and they sit safely in 12th place but just two wins in their past 11 league games has seemingly been a cause for concern for the club’s owners.

692	West Brom	West Ham United	0	3	30/04/2016	16	Slaven Bilic’s decison to rest players for the FA Cup sixth-round replay against Manchester United earlier this month showed the manager had serious ambitions about finishing in the top four. But a renaissance in fortunes for both Manchester clubs means West Ham must win this afternoon and hope Arsenal lose to stand a chance of reaching the Champions League. At least Bilic has a full squad to choose from for the trip to the Hawthorns, with striker Andy Carroll hoping to build on a run of six goals in his last six games. West Brom’s battling second half display against Spurs on Monday showed Tony Pulis’s side are not on the beach just yet, however. Ed Aarons	-1	0.08431589603424072,0.967757910490036
693	Aston Villa	Newcastle United	0	0	07/05/2016	16	Three points are a must for Newcastle to stay ahead in the race to avoid relegation. Rafael Benítez has provided United with a new-found confidence and, unbeaten in four, they should really have the measure of a Villa side whose embarrassing run of defeats now stands at 11. While they scored twice in their past two games, a shambolic defence has shipped four and three in the process. Alan Smith	0	0.9884181618690491,0.9978132247924805
694	Bournemouth	West Brom	1	1	07/05/2016	16	It is likely to be last on Match of the Day but Eddie Howe will be keen for Bournemouth to put on a performance in their final home game of an impressive debut season in the Premier League. So much so, the Bournemouth chairman, Jeff Mostyn, has forewarned supporters not to go on the pitch at the final whistle. Albion travel to the south coast level on points with the home side, who have lost five of their past six matches. Tony Pulis’s side are guilty of indifferent form themselves but salvaged a draw in their last away match at Tottenham and are more than capable of upsetting the mood once more here. Ben Fisher	0	0.9873024423917135,0.9942913353443146
695	Crystal Palace	Stoke City	2	1	07/05/2016	16	Alan Pardew’s instinct will be to protect his players for the club’s second FA Cup final later this month but Crystal Palace, hampered by strains and sniffles, have won only once in 19 games – half the league campaign – and are still not mathematically safe. A point against a Stoke side who have been beaten twice already this season and whose own form has unravelled of late will be enough to guarantee the hosts a third top-flight campaign, and allow them to refocus on Wembley on 21 May.

696	Leicester City	Everton	3	1	07/05/2016	16	Last term this was Leicester’s first fixture back after 10 years’ absence and they had only four men with top-flight experience. This time Everton will give the new champions a guard of honour, free beer and pizza vouchers will be given to home fans and the Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli will serenade them as the party goes on.

697	Norwich City	Manchester United	0	1	07/05/2016	16	Alex Neil felt last weekend’s defeat at Arsenal was their best away performance against one of the bigger teams this season but the clock is ticking at speed now and three consecutive defeats – with no goals scored – have come at the worst possible time. Another home game in midweek against Watford is an opportunity to pick up points but they cannot afford to have fallen further adrift by then and something is surely required from an upbeat Manchester United.

698	Sunderland	Chelsea	3	2	07/05/2016	16	Sunderland really need to win this to keep their survival hopes intact but considering they have not scored in their last three home games and how they have historically struggled against last season’s champions – winning only two of the past 24 meetings – it will not be easy. Sam Allardyce’s team will also know Norwich’s result by the time they get under way potentially adding more pressure. Alan Smith	1	-0.8618994951248169,0
699	West Ham United	Swansea City	1	4	07/05/2016	16	Swansea banished any lingering relegation fears with Sunday’s win over Liverpool, and their thoughts are now surely turning to finding a manager for next season. West Ham still have European places to play for, however, and while this penultimate game at Upton Park will be upstaged by Manchester United’s visit on Tuesday, Slaven Bilic has not given up on scraping into the top four.

700	Liverpool	Watford	2	0	08/05/2016	16	The Europa League final may be Liverpool’s focus, and Jürgen Klopp has confirmed the intensity of Thursday’s semi-final against Villarreal will influence his selection against Watford, but cup final places and the desire to finish higher than eighth should provide sufficient motivation at Anfield. Klopp cites the 3-0 defeat at Vicarage Road as one of the worst displays of his Liverpool tenure and will not want his players bullied again by Quique Sánchez Flores’s team.

701	Manchester City	Arsenal	2	2	08/05/2016	16	Manchester City know if Manchester United and West Ham United lose their respective matches then victory over Arsenal secures a place in next season’s Champions League.

702	Tottenham Hotspur	Southampton	1	2	08/05/2016	16	There is not, generally, a massive difference between coming in second rather than third but, for Tottenham, it would mean the world. The disappointment of their collapsed Premier League title push is still fresh but there remains the significant matter of finishing above Arsenal for the first time since 1994-95. Tottenham have guaranteed themselves a place in the top three but the runners-up spot would ensure that they finally enjoy supremacy in their neighbourhood. Southampton’s motivation continues to be Europa League qualification. David Hytner	-1	0.8349144756793976,0.9936561584472656
703	Arsenal	Aston Villa	4	0	15/05/2016	16	Arsenal have an outside chance of finishing second, which they have not done since 2004-05 and so it is possible that a campaign marked by frustration and volatility could end on something of a positive. It would be sweet for them if they could pip Tottenham and finish above them as they always do but thoughts have already turned to next season. The mood and the attendance at the Emirates will be interesting. Villa just want it all to stop. David Hytner	1	0.45427878697713214,-0.9996224641799927
704	Chelsea	Leicester City	1	1	15/05/2016	16	The football at Stamford Bridge will almost feel incidental. More enticing will be the joyous reception granted the returning Claudio Ranieri with Roman Abramovich, the man who sacked him back in 2004, potentially watching on from his box in the West stand. Then there will be the accolades for Leicester City’schampions, and a second farewell to Guus Hiddink. Beyond that, the locals will merely be thankful this trying campaign is finally over.

705	Everton	Norwich City	3	0	15/05/2016	16	An afternoon with David Unsworth, Joe Royle and Duncan Ferguson sounds more like a sportsman’s dinner than a Premier League fixture but the trio of ex-Evertonians will lift Goodison Park’s mood following the sacking of Roberto Martínez. The visit of relegated Norwich City would have been a mutinous, horrible affair had Martínez been kept on for one more game and it will be revealing if his former players suddenly show more commitment than they have done in recent weeks.

706	Newcastle United	Tottenham Hotspur	5	1	15/05/2016	16	Tottenham require a point to secure second place and finish above Arsenal for the first time since the 1994-95 season. Rafael Benítez, though, wants to extend already relegated Newcastle’s five-game unbeaten run on an afternoon when home fans are planning to serenade the Spaniard in the hope of persuading him to stick around next season and lead them out of the second tier. Tyneside’s Evening Chronicle devoted Friday’s front page to imploring Benítez to stay but some fear Everton might steal him. Louise Taylor	1	-0.16891250014305115,0.9848445057868958
707	Southampton	Crystal Palace	4	1	15/05/2016	16	Six wins from their last eight games have propelled Southampton up the table and they know victory tomorrow could be enough for them to steal sixth, and even possibly fifth place. Alan Pardew returns to a club where he had perhaps his least impressive spell in management with next Saturday’s FA Cup final on his mind, even more so after Joe Ledley’s unfortunate leg-break against Stoke last week, so an under-strength Crystal Palace side is a distinct possibility.

Stoke City will be eager to end on a high and hold on to their place in the top 10 after picking up two points from their past six games. Jacob Steinberg	1	0,0.9986973404884338
709	Swansea City	Manchester City	1	1	15/05/2016	16	West Ham’s late heroics on Tuesday night put Manchester City’s destiny back in their own hands and avoiding defeat tomorrow will suffice for them to finish in fourth place, even if hoping for Arsenal to lose at home to Aston Villa to have a chance of third may be pushing it. There were times this season when being comfortably safe on the last day looked highly unlikely for Swansea, and while the decision to award Francesco Guidolin the job full-time this week was a surprise, it was a deserved one. The Italian has probably done enough since succeeding Garry Monk to deserve a crack at a season from the start. Paul Chronnell	0	0.9976858198642731,0.9959444403648376
710	Watford	Sunderland	2	2	15/05/2016	16	One club, the fifth biggest in the league if ranked by stadium capacity, is delighted just to have avoided relegation; the other, recently promoted and 18th in the same rankings, is so disappointed to have spent the season in mid-table that they have just disposed of their manager. Sunderland will come 17th whatever happens but go into the gameare on a wave of survivalist euphoria; Watford could finish as low as 16th or as high as 11th, a difference of £6,180,415 in “merit payments”, but motivation may still be an issue.

711	West Brom	Liverpool	1	1	15/05/2016	16	With Liverpool’s focus very much on Wednesday’s Europa League final against Sevilla in Basel, Jürgen Klopp is likely to name an under-strength side for the final league game. That could help Tony Pulis’s attempts to deliver some entertainment to Albion fans in their final match of a season in which they have steered clear of trouble but had precious few reasons to cheer.

712	Manchester United	Bournemouth	3	1	17/05/2016	16	The question for Manchester United fans is simple and painful: how did it come to needing to beat Bournemouth and Manchester City to lose at Swansea to qualify for the Champions League? This is the barest of requirements for the United behemoth and expect Louis van Gaal’s job to be severely scrutinised should they end the season, as they begin Sunday as favourites to do, outside the top four. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.9990155696868896,0
713	Burnley	Swansea City	0	1	13/08/2016	17	This already has the feel of a game that will set the tone for both clubs’ fortunes. Burnley should give a debut to Johann Berg Gudmundsson but he is their only outfield signing so far – Aston Villa’s Ashley Westwood may follow – and there are concerns that last season’s Championship winners are thin on numbers and quality. Swansea must adjust to losing Ashley Williams and André Ayew in quick succession and the match comes too soon for record signing Borja Bastón. Both squads should look stronger at the month’s end but a negative start could be hard to claw back. Nick Ames	-1	-0.33275143305460614,-0.9947590231895447
714	Crystal Palace	West Brom	0	1	13/08/2016	17	On paper this game between two of last season’s three lowest scoring sides may suggest a shortage of goals but their most recent meeting, at The Hawthorns in February, was a 3-2 classic. Yannick Bolasie looks to be on his way out of Palace but Alan Pardew expects him to be involved here, while Saido Berahino is in the visitors’ squad despite a chance he will move to Selhurst Park.

715	Everton	Tottenham Hotspur	1	1	13/08/2016	17	Two teams that a season ago may have considered themselves equals come into the new campaign worlds apart. Ronald Koeman is in the process of rebuilding a squad that is lacking defensively, while Mauricio Pochettino will hope for further development from his talented young group. Everton have drawn their past three opening games 2-2, and a fourth would see them reach eight winless matches against Tottenham. Conor Matchett	0	0.7962530553340912,0
716	Hull City	Leicester City	2	1	13/08/2016	17	Leicester City could hardly face an easier opening to their title defence. Managerless Hull City, with only 13 fit professionals, look ripe for the taking. The home side will be particularly short in defence, with three centre-backs – Alex Bruce, Harry Maguire and the captain, Michael Dawson – injured, as well as the goalkeeper Alan McGregor. Suspension means Robert Huth is the only notable absentee for Leicester, who may give a debut to Ahmed Musa. Paul Macinnes	1	-0.020449399948120117,-0.990294873714447
717	Manchester City	Sunderland	2	1	13/08/2016	17	However much Pep Guardiola tries to downplay it, all eyes watch the impact he will make. For now, with Vincent Kompany injured, he welcomes David Moyes’s side with a defence featuring new signing John Stones plunged straight in, so a win by any manner will do. Yet given the club’s riches and the 45-year-old’s pedigree there is no excuse for Guardiola not to have City as serious contenders. The missions starts here. Jamie Jackson	1	0.49623903632164,0
718	Middlesbrough	Stoke City	1	1	13/08/2016	17	Back in the Premier League after a seven-year exile, Middlesbrough should showcase several of the nine new faces Aitor Karanka has imported to the Riverside this summer. Boro fans will be keen to take a first look at Víctor Valdés, Álvaro Negredo, Marten de Roon et al, while Joe Allen is set to make his Stoke debut following a £13m move from Liverpool. Given that Karanka’s side conceded only eight Championship goals at home last season Mark Hughes must trust his strikers are wearing their shooting boots. Louise Taylor	0	0.9938687980175018,0
719	Southampton	Watford	1	1	13/08/2016	17	Both clubs go into the new season with new managers for the first time since Alan Pardew and Malky Mackay were in charge of the respective clubs. Frenchman Claude Puel has joined Southampton while Italian maverick Walter Mazzarri takes charge of his first competitive match at Watford. The Saints are unbeaten in their past five against the visitors, and will be aiming to continue that run. Conor Matchett	0	0.9982389211654663,0
720	Arsenal	Liverpool	3	4	14/08/2016	17	Arsène Wenger is expected to be without a number of players on fitness grounds and he will be forced to field a makeshift central defensive partnership. It is easy to feel that the new season has come too soon for him and Arsenal, and Liverpool, who have injury concerns of their own, will seek to heighten the nagging anxiety at the Emirates. They do, however, have a poor away record against Arsenal, winning only once in 20 matches across 15 years. David Hytner	-1	-0.9990909496943156,0
721	Bournemouth	Manchester United	1	3	14/08/2016	17	José Mourinho’s penultimate match in charge of Chelsea ended in a chastening defeat by Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge, so his first Premier League match as Manchester United manager may feel remotely familiar. Mourinho will hope the summer arrivals, namely Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Henrikh Mkhitaryan can ensure a different outcome against Eddie Howe’s men this time around. “Zlatan is a great player, but you can pick any one of their players who will be a threat to us,” said Howe, who could give debuts to Jordon Ibe and Lewis Cook. “We’re looking forward to the game.” Ben Fisher	-1	0.9898953139781952,-0.9949931502342224
722	Chelsea	West Ham United	2	1	15/08/2016	17	This could be the game of the opening weekend. Antonio Conte may need some time to leave his mark on Chelsea but there is justified excitement at Stamford Bridge after last season’s horrors. West Ham arrive with two competitive games under their belt after progressing in the Europa League and it will be fascinating to see if Slaven Bilic can improve on last year’s fine performance.

723	Burnley	Liverpool	2	0	20/08/2016	17	Two consecutive home games might have appeared an agreeable reintroduction to top-flight football for Burnley but it will not feel that way if last week’s defeat to Swansea is followed by another. Steven Defour should make his debut in midfield with David Jones having joined Sheffield Wednesday; Sean Dyche must wait to field Jon Flanagan, unavailable as he is on loan from Liverpool. An active Liverpool full-back, Alberto Moreno, was criticised after the 4-3 win at Arsenal but will retain his place after being backed by Jürgen Klopp. Nick Ames	1	-0.9906830787658691,0.9979943037033081
724	Leicester City	Arsenal	0	0	20/08/2016	17	The season has barely got under way and yet, on the back of defeats on the opening weekend, this already feels like a significant game for both clubs. Arsenal did the double over Leicester last season but were second best to them where it really mattered and they also failed in an attempt to sign Jamie Vardy in the summer. Robert Huth is back from suspension for Leicester while Laurent Koscielny, Mesut Özil and Olivier Giroud could all return for Arsenal. Stuart James	0	0,-0.9988099336624146
725	Stoke City	Manchester City	1	4	20/08/2016	17	Can Pep Guardiola do it on a temperate afternoon in Stoke? Quite probably, unless the home side start more quickly than they did at Middlesbrough. last week. Mark Hughes waits on the fitness of Xherdan Shaqiri, whose free-kick illuminated a much better second half, before deciding who faces his old club and will have to continue with another City old boy, the 40-year-old Shay Given, in goal while Jack Butland is laid low. Guardiola has no such issues; his own first-choice keeper, Willy Caballero, is fighting fit. Nick Ames	-1	-0.9946494102478027,0.803802490234375
726	Swansea City	Hull City	0	2	20/08/2016	17	The opening day brought welcome victories for both clubs – unexpectedly so in the case of Hull, who have not added to their threadbare squad since beating Leicester and remain without a permanent manager. Gylfi Sigurdsson, who came off the bench at Burnley, could start for Swansea. Borja Baston, Swansea’s club-record signing, has been ruled out with a thigh injury, Neil Taylor is being given more time to recover from Euro 2016 and Leon Britton has been laid low with illness this week.

727	Tottenham Hotspur	Crystal Palace	1	0	20/08/2016	17	Crystal Palace looked bereft of ideas in attack against West Brom on the opening day and they cross London this afternoon with Mile Jedinak and Yannick Bolasie no longer in their ranks. Connor Wickham will be keen to impress before Christian Benteke gets involved. It all points to a first win of the campaign for Tottenham, following on from their draw against Everton last weekend.

728	Watford	Chelsea	1	2	20/08/2016	17	Despite the best intentions of both managers this reunion has been billed as a grudge match. Antonio Conte earned Walter Mazzarri’s ire after mimicking his formation in a crunch Serie A fixture five years ago. He looks set to name an unchanged side after Chelsea’s late win over West Ham on Monday. The arrival of Younès Kaboul and Argentine midfielder Roberto Pereyra meanwhile will come too late for Watford this weekend, for whom Ben Watson is also suspended after his red card against Southampton.

729	West Brom	Everton	1	2	20/08/2016	17	West Brom and Yannick Bolasie could face each other for the second consecutive weekend after the attacker moved from Crystal Palace to Everton in midweek. Ronald Koeman will need to decide whether to use him from the start or as a substitute, though that could depend on the fitness of Romelu Lukaku. Ashley Williams’ availability is also touch and go for the visitors. Alan Smith	-1	0.9979392886161804,-0.9981343150138855
730	Sunderland	Middlesbrough	1	2	21/08/2016	17	While Wear-Tees clashes lack the fierce intensity of their Tyne-Wear cousins – the clubs are 35 miles apart – the atmosphere will still be highly charged. If David Moyes must trust Younès Kaboul’s defection to Watford does not leave Álvaro Negredo scenting blood, Jermain Defoe would relish defying Víctor Valdés. For the past five seasons Sunderland have failed to win a league game in August but, much as Moyes wants to put that right in his first home league match with his new club, Aitor Karanka could do with a derby win.

731	West Ham United	Bournemouth	1	0	21/08/2016	17	Losing at Chelsea on Monday before playing in Romania on Thursday night was not the ideal way for West Ham United to prepare for their Premier League debut in their new ground. It has been a slow start to the season for the Hammers and Slaven Bilic will hope to have Dimitri Payet available from the start. Bournemouth, beaten by Manchester United last weekend, won this fixture last year thanks to Callum Wilson’s hat-trick. Jacob Steinberg	1	-0.9952193200588226,0.9994494318962097
732	Chelsea	Burnley	3	0	27/08/2016	17	Burnley’s eye-catching win over Liverpool last weekend served as a warning to Chelsea that a fixture which once might have been considered a likely walkover actually has the potential to be awkward. “They are a very solid team in defensive situations, and always ready to go on the counter-attack with two forwards,” said Antonio Conte, who was impressed by Sean Dyche when the pair met at a coaches’ meeting in pre-season. “This is dangerous.” All three of his side’s successes to date have been narrow and nerve-jangling. This, too, should prove tight. Dominic Fifield	1	0,-0.33224807182947796
733	Crystal Palace	Bournemouth	1	1	27/08/2016	17	Something will have to give at Selhurst Park. These sides are currently pointless at the foot of the table, with Crystal Palace having been undone by set-pieces in each of their games and Christian Benteke’s lack of match fitness likely to see the record signing start on the bench. Wilfried Zaha may join him there after asking to leave this week. Bournemouth won in south-east London earlier this year as they surged to safety and Palace slipped the other way. This could condemn one of the sides to an international window dogged by self-doubt. Dominic Fifield	0	0.329756220181783,-0.0047702789306640625
734	Everton	Stoke City	1	0	27/08/2016	17	Romelu Lukaku changed the game from the bench in the 2-1 win at West Brom and is expected to lead the line against a Stoke side looking for an unprecedented third win in a row at Goodison. The last was a 4-3 thriller in December and Xherdan Shaqiri, who scored twice in that game, should be back while Peter Crouch is keen for an airing after his midweek hat-trick at Stevenage.

735	Leicester City	Swansea City	2	1	27/08/2016	17	Leicester City, while not desperate for a win, could use a momentum-building victory against Swansea City before their Champions League debut. Claudio Ranieri will be hoping for better service to, and better finishing from, Jamie Vardy, who has yet to record a shot on target this season. If Swansea inflict another defeat on the champions, panic could take hold of Leicester’s pizzerias. Graham Searles	1	-0.14891669154167175,0
736	Southampton	Sunderland	1	1	27/08/2016	17	David Moyes upset some fans by suggesting this week that Sunderland should expect to find themselves in another relegation fight this season if reinforcements are not bought soon. But the lack of ambition in the manager’s approach on the pitch in Sunderland’s first two matches should be of more concern. Moyes would be well advised to get a better display from his side at St Mary’s, where Southampton’s manager, Claude Puel, is looking for a first league win.

737	Tottenham Hotspur	Liverpool	1	1	27/08/2016	17	A lot has happened since Jürgen Klopp’s first game in charge of Liverpool at White Hart Lane last October but not so much has changed. Problems with consistency continue , which Klopp had alluded to well before their chastening defeat by Burnley last weekend. Tottenham Hotspur, too, are yet to find top gear this season after stuttering to their first win of the season against Crystal Palace but Klopp is wary of their talents. “We know they are strong, that’s the only thing we need to know,” he said. “We can be strong too and should show this on Saturday.” Ben Fisher	0	-0.9863744974136353,-0.9879336953163147
738	Watford	Arsenal	1	3	27/08/2016	17	With Arsenal already five points behind in the title race after only two games, Arsène Wenger needs a victory at Vicarage Road. Not that Walter Mazzarri’s Watford are without their own concerns after losing their past two matches. Mazzarri has been busy in the transfer window but the new signings Roberto Pereyra, Younès Kaboul and Daryl Janmaat are unlikely to start. Paul MacInnes	-1	-0.991592139005661,-0.9757423400878906
739	Manchester City	West Ham United	3	1	28/08/2016	17	So far, so very good for the Pep Guardiola Manchester City project. A disrupted pre-season is no longer a factor and the Catalan’s side are flying. What will fascinate is when the Pep bounce falters and his side suffer a defeat. Slaven Bilic’s West Ham United won at the Etihad Stadium 2-1 last season, so might they be the team to offer City a first taste of adversity? Jamie Jackson	1	0.327933390935262,0.8656238317489624
740	West Brom	Middlesbrough	0	0	28/08/2016	17	This will be the first meeting between these sides since 2010 but the recent record is overwhelmingly in favour of the host club. Albion have won the past four, scoring 11 goals without conceding one – including 5-0 and 3-0 wins. Yet Middlesbrough will fancy their chances of a win following a solid start to the season – despite the midweek cup loss at Fulham. It will be close.

741	Arsenal	Southampton	2	1	10/09/2016	17	Shkodran Mustafi could make his Arsenal debut and Lucas Pérez is also available for his first appearance. Arsène Wenger said he has the “most mature squad for a long time” but they will not find it easy against Southampton, who will be hoping Fraser Forster is fit after missing England’s trip to Slovakia with an arm injury. Ryan Bertrand is also available. Alan Smith	1	0.006539732217788696,0.9982761144638062
742	Bournemouth	West Brom	1	0	10/09/2016	17	Eddie Howe is expected to give Jack Wilshere his competitive debut, although the manager revealed he has had to manage the midfielder’s workload. “We have to get the balance right between getting him fitter and making sure he does not break down,” said Howe. Wilshere’s last league goal for Arsenal was in May 2015 against West Brom, whose manager, Tony Pulis, coached Howe as a teenager. Ben Fisher	1	0.9508140881856283,0.9856094717979431
743	Burnley	Hull City	1	1	10/09/2016	17	If proof were needed the Premier League rarely goes as one would expect, Burnley’s first two home games – a defeat to Swansea and a win over Liverpool – have underlined the point. A 3-0 defeat at Chelsea was rather more predictable but it is hard to know what to expect against a Hull side who were seconds away from an unbeaten start before losing to Manchester United.

Anticipation is rife having spent August on the road and with the champions representing an awkward return home. Both Liverpool and Leicester have had a mixed start but will be looking to build on encouraging displays before the international break.

745	Manchester United	Manchester City	1	2	10/09/2016	17	After the hype, the match. The Manchester derby will offer clues about how United and City will fare this season and nothing more. Students of body language, the media, and fans will watch José Mourinho and Pep Guardiola, particularly around handshake time, but remember this: all that matters is what occurs on the pitch. The prospect is enticing. Jamie Jackson	-1	0.9964520633220673,0
746	Middlesbrough	Crystal Palace	1	2	10/09/2016	17	As if the potential beauty contest between those formidable centre forwards - Álvaro Negredo and Christian Benteke - was not sufficiently compelling, Alan Pardew has spiced things up by naming two Bentekes in his squad. Christian’s younger brother, and fellow striker, Jonathan is expected to be on the bench against a Middlesbrough side unbeaten in the league. Palace have only one point but might the pair’s respective early season positions be deceptive? An intriguing litmus test - not to mention clash of two contrasting counter-attacking styles - beckons.

747	Stoke City	Tottenham Hotspur	0	4	10/09/2016	17	Stoke’s injury problems show little sign of abating and their task will become harder if Tottenham inflict a third defeat in four games. Xherdan Shaqiri and Mame Biram Diouf are the latest casualties although there should be debuts for the defender Bruno Martins Indi and, up front, Wilfried Bony, both signed on loan before the deadline. Mark Hughes must decide whether to persist with a relatively conservative three-man central midfield against Tottenham, whose own start has been more solid than spectacular.

748	West Ham United	Watford	2	4	10/09/2016	17	Last season’s star player, Dimitri Payet, and recent signing from Juventus, Simone Zaza, are set to be included from the start by Slaven Bilic against a Watford side who have had a tough start to the season. Another former Juve player, Robert Pereyra, should start for the visitors, having made his debut from the bench in the defeat at home to Arsenal. Alan Smith	-1	0,0.9959443410237631
749	Swansea City	Chelsea	2	2	11/09/2016	17	Borja Bastón, Swansea’s record signing, could make his debut for the hosts (assuming the striker has sufficiently recovered from a thigh injury) and will immediately be tasked with getting the better of David Luiz. The Brazilian’s return to Chelsea caught many by surprise but Antonio Conte thinks the 29-year-old could still become one of the world’s best defenders.

750	Sunderland	Everton	0	3	12/09/2016	17	Once so synonymous with Everton, David Moyes finds himself plotting the potential downfall of the team he managed for more than a decade. He will be assisted on the pitch by fellow Goodison Park old boys Steven Pienaar and Jack Rodwell, while a not yet fully fit Victor Anichebe looks on from the sidelines as Sunderland seek a morale-boosting first league win of the season.

751	Everton	Middlesbrough	3	1	17/09/2016	17	Middlesbrough have made a solid return to the top flight but their hosts will be full of confidence having made their best start to a campaign for a decade. Gareth Barry will join Ryan Giggs and Frank Lampard in the Premier League’s 600-club, 18 years after his debut for Aston Villa at Sheffield Wednesday, but whether Ross Barkley will join the immaculate veteran in midfield remains to be seen. Ronald Koeman has not shied from the big calls on the England international, on the pitch or in public. Romelu Lukaku is back among the goals after his hat-trick at Sunderland.

Danny Simpson is fit again and Islam Slimani is in line to make his first Premier League appearance as the champions go in search of a second league win.

754	Manchester City	Bournemouth	4	0	17/09/2016	17	The record shows a magnificent seven wins from seven outings for Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City. The Catalan is already creating the myth that a side can be beaten before they walk past the white line for kick-off. Can, then, Bournemouth do what no other side has yet and, at least, fashion a draw? It appears a slim prospect even though City are without the sublime and prolific Sergio Agüero, who is suspended.

755	West Brom	West Ham United	4	2	17/09/2016	17	Tony Pulis remains in charge at West Brom but for how much longer? The manager’s weakened relationship with club hierarchy has dominated the buildup to this game. For West Ham so much has been made of the teething problems at their new stadium that their below-par start to the season has not been given as much attention as perhaps it should. Both could badly do with a win. Alan Smith	1	-0.9823341369628906,-0.9995468258857727
756	Crystal Palace	Stoke City	4	1	18/09/2016	17	Crystal Palace’s latest attempt to rejuvenate their home form will be undertaken without Pape Souaré, who faces up to six months out with the injuries sustained in Sunday’s car crash on the M4. Alan Pardew and his players have visited the Senegalese in hospital this week and that might focus minds against Stoke, who prop up the division. Mark Hughes’ side have not prevailed in any of their last six games against Palace. They, too, are in need of a revival. Dominic Fifield	1	-0.9823484122753143,-0.9399329423904419
757	Southampton	Swansea City	1	0	18/09/2016	17	Thursday’s Europa League victory over Sparta Prague gave Claude Puel the first win of his reign and some welcome selection options. Charlie Austin put forward a strong case for a start against Swansea by scoring twice against the Czechs and the whole team looked comfortable in a 4-3-3 formation. The manager could build on that performance as he seeks his first Premier League win. Paul Doyle	1	0.9998527765274048,0.9996787309646606
758	Tottenham Hotspur	Sunderland	1	0	18/09/2016	17	The disappointment of Tottenham’s midweek Champions League defeat by Monaco at Wembley cut deep, with Mauricio Pochettino particularly upset at what he saw as a lack of intensity and decisiveness. The manager wants Sunderland to feel the backlash and, with David Moyes experiencing plenty of problems at the north-east club, Tottenham have a good opportunity to bounce back. Sunderland, winless and joint-bottom of the table, have a dismal record at White Hart Lane. David Hytner	1	-0.0036128461360931396,0.000626295804977417
759	Watford	Manchester United	3	1	18/09/2016	17	After a strong start to their season Manchester United find themselves on a two-game losing streak. Watford’s impressive four-goal comeback against West Ham last Saturday means United need to be wary. That said, José Mourinho is a chip-on-his-shoulder specialist and will no doubt be drilling into his side that victory must be the only outcome to keep up with their noisy neighbours.

760	Arsenal	Chelsea	3	0	24/09/2016	17	Arsène Wenger calls them “the inconvenient facts of the recent years”. To Chelsea it has been capital city supremacy. In the previous 10 editions of this fixture – excluding the Community Shield – the west London club have won seven times and there have been three draws. Wenger has called on his Arsenal players to buck the trend and nullifying Diego Costa is at the top of his agenda. The subplots are numerous and rich. Expect fireworks.

761	Bournemouth	Everton	1	0	24/09/2016	17	Everton travel to Bournemouth aware that victory could take them top of the Premier League. Regardless of that, it’s another opportunity for Ronald Koeman’s side to showcase their intentions, while they can extend their unbeaten start in the league to six matches. Romelu Lukaku, who has scored five goals already this month, is expected to return from a toe injury after missing the midweek EFL Cup defeat by Norwich City. This fixture last season acted as a springboard for Bournemouth, who equalised in the eighth minute of stoppage time to record a 3-3 draw. The neutrals, and Bournemouth, would most probably settle for the same again this time around. Ben Fisher	1	0.3292781909306844,0.33766263723373413
762	Liverpool	Hull City	5	1	24/09/2016	17	Mike Phelan is unbeaten in four away matches as caretaker manager of Hull but confronts a Liverpool team that has clicked impressively and is seeking a fourth consecutive win in all competitions. Jürgen Klopp has a big call to make in goal, with Loris Karius pressing Simon Mignolet for inclusion, and faces a sustained test of Liverpool’s consistency with five of their next six games after Hull coming against sides who beat them last season. Hence the manager’s plea for patience from the Anfield crowd. Andy Hunter	1	0.33230264981587726,0
763	Manchester United	Leicester City	4	1	24/09/2016	17	Six points is already the gap to Manchester City as José Mourinho chases a desperately required win and decides whether to drop Wayne Rooney. The Portuguese is intent on ensuring Paul Pogba plays in his best position, so expect him on the left of a Manchester United 4-3-3. If, then, the captain is to be accommodated Anthony Martial’s injury may allow Rooney to play on the left of the front three. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.34849315881729126,0.9837904572486877
764	Middlesbrough	Tottenham Hotspur	1	2	24/09/2016	17	Aitor Karanka and Mauricio Pochettino are old friends from the pair’s playing days in Spain. Later the two former centre halves were fast tracked through their coaching badges on the same course in Madrid. Back then they could surely never have guessed that, almost a decade on, they would be reunited on Teesside with Karanka’s Middlesbrough hosting the Argentinian’s Tottenham. After straight defeats against Crystal Palace and Everton, Boro could do with a win and will hope to capitalise on Harry Kane’s absence. Louise Taylor	-1	0.5041017532348633,0.9994275569915771
765	Stoke City	West Brom	1	1	24/09/2016	17	If a degree of pressure was removed from Tony Pulis’s shoulders after West Brom’s win over West Ham, the knives will be out in force at his old club if Mark Hughes’s side fails again here. How Hughes can arrest a slump that has brought four limp defeats in a row, along with a League Cup exit to Hull, is anyone’s guess but Stoke’s treatment table is at least clearing and Xherdan Shaqiri may be able to play some part after recovering from the calf injury that has sidelined him since the opening day.

766	Sunderland	Crystal Palace	2	3	24/09/2016	17	As Newcastle United manager, Alan Pardew suffered horribly at the hands of Sunderland and he would hardly be human were he not particularly keen to see Crystal Palace celebrate victory on Wearside. Such an event would represent a significant blow to David Moyes who is desperate to secure his first league win at Sunderland. Doing so will have to see his side attack more fluently as they have unleashed the fewest shots in the top tier this season and scored only three goals in their opening five fixtures. Louise Taylor	-1	-0.99568971991539,0.9832514524459839
767	Swansea City	Manchester City	1	3	24/09/2016	17	This is the second meeting in four days between these clubs, with Swansea and Manchester City making 17 changes between them for the EFL Cup game on Tuesday. The bad news for Swansea is that Sergio Agüero is back from suspension, which is the last thing Francesco Guidolin needs right now. Swansea’s manager is on the brink and another damaging result here could spell the end. Pep Guardiola, in contrast, goes in search of a 10th successive win in all competitions. Stuart James	-1	-0.9977680444717407,-0.937824547290802
768	West Ham United	Southampton	0	3	25/09/2016	17	West Ham United could be bottom by the time they take on Southampton. At least Dimitri Payet’s late winner against Accrington Stanley in the EFL Cup restored some belief. Yet it is likely to be another fraught afternoon at the London Stadium, on and off the pitch, unless West Ham plug the holes in their defence. Meanwhile, Claude Puel’s side are looking for their fourth straight win in all competitions. Jacob Steinberg	-1	-0.3354794979095459,0.9988881945610046
769	Burnley	Watford	2	0	26/09/2016	17	Sean Dyche might have been particularly confident of getting one over his old club had this fixture taken place two weeks ago but Watford have taken off since and Burnley begin Monday night’s game on the back of a 3-0 defeat at Leicester. They used a more cautious 4-2-3-1 shape at the King Power Stadium but may recall Sam Vokes to their normal 4-4-2 here or even hand a first start to loanee Patrick Bamford. Johann Berg Gudmundsson is another who could be recalled if Dyche fancies starting on the front foot.Nick Ames	1	-0.17106688022613525,0.9809838533401489
770	Arsenal	Swansea City	3	2	15/10/2016	17	Bob Bradley has demonstrated his ability to talk the talk, as anybody present at his Swansea media unveiling will attest – now, he has to walk the walk, at a stadium where his side have fared well of late. Arsène Wenger said the American’s appointment was “good for the Premier League, because it is taking off in the States”, but the Arsenal manager’s concern is to record a home league win over Swansea for the first time since 2011. David Hytner	1	0.9963938593864441,0.9962533712387085
771	Bournemouth	Hull City	6	1	15/10/2016	17	After finally being given the full-time manager’s job on Thursday, Mike Phelan takes charge of Hull City on a permanent basis for the first time. It’s perhaps not one of the toughest trips at first glance, but Bournemouth are searching for a third straight home win in the Premier League. The on-loan Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere, who last played 90 minutes more than two years ago, is again likely to start behind the striker Callum Wilson, who is beginning to show glimpses of his best form. Ben Fisher	1	0.9758957227071127,0.9985402822494507
772	Chelsea	Leicester City	3	0	15/10/2016	17	The Premier League champions from the last two campaigns meet at Stamford Bridge with Antonio Conte obliged to reiterate the strength of his relationship with the Chelsea hierarchy after various bookmakers closed the market on his premature departure on Thursday. “I’m trying to find out who put the money on,” he joked. “But I’m focused. I’m focused on improving my team, and I have good communication and a good relationship with the club. I take this with a smile.” He will retain his back three against Leicester, pointless away from home to date, and must decide whether John Terry returns to his lineup after injury.

773	Crystal Palace	West Ham United	0	1	15/10/2016	17	West Ham United would appear to be there for the taking. A team struggling to adapt to a new home have yet to gain anything other than bloodied noses away from Stratford this term, with nine goals conceded in three defeats. Yet Alan Pardew and Crystal Palace are still braced for an awkward derby. West Ham have won 3-1 on their last two visits to Selhurst Park, “and they’ve got some fantastic players, players of international standard or even world-class ability,” offered Pardew. Palace must ensure the revival does not start south of the river. Dominic Fifield	-1	-0.2591742475827535,0.9980627596378326
774	Manchester City	Everton	1	1	15/10/2016	17	Manchester City can bounce straight back from their first loss at Tottenham and stretch the gap between themselves and Everton to seven points. Kevin De Bruyne could start after his injury but whether Pep Guardiola will risk him before Wednesday’s trip to Barcelona is the question. If Ronald Koeman’s side were to record an away win, expect an inquiry at City. Jamie Jackson	0	-0.3827892740567525,0
775	Stoke City	Sunderland	2	0	15/10/2016	17	David Moyes has lost only three of his 17 league meetings with Mark Hughes but the Stoke manager considers this to be the first of seven winnable games, a reasonable return from which would improve the mood after failing to register one in their first seven. Sunderland, too, have yet to win and they occupy bottom spot, with the West Brom draw last time out representing an up-turn. Mark Tallentire	1	0.9979585111141205,-0.9955357313156128
776	West Brom	Tottenham Hotspur	1	1	15/10/2016	17	Nacer Chadli has been a breath of fresh air for West Brom and the Belgium attacking midfielder may be motivated to show his former club what they are missing. His time at White Hart Lane fizzled out, and he found a starting berth hard to come by. Yet he has impressed at The Hawthorns, becoming they key creator for Tony Pulis’s team. Finding a way past Spurs will still be difficult though. Alan Smith	0	0.9975328743457794,-0.9966064691543579
777	Middlesbrough	Watford	0	1	16/10/2016	17	With only one League win this season – against Sunderland – Middlesbrough could do with registering a first victory at the Riverside since April. Six points from seven games is a slightly disappointing return for Aitor Karanka who needs more from the currently under-achieving Gaston Ramírez and can only hope Álvaro Negredo rediscovers his scoring touch. In contrast, Watford’s Troy Deeney has scored three times in the last four games and Walter Mazzarri has challenged his centre forward to break into the England team.

778	Southampton	Burnley	3	1	16/10/2016	17	Southampton face a test to sustain their fine form as they go into the first of seven matches in 22 days with important defensive injuries. Both of their first-choice full-backs will miss the visit of Burnley, who will be aiming to become the first team in seven matches to score against Southampton. Sean Dyche’s side have also been performing well lately and will fancy their chances of collecting their first away point of the campaign. Paul Doyle	1	0.9787399768829346,0.00023680925369262695
779	Liverpool	Manchester United	0	0	17/10/2016	17	José Mourinho has lost only three of his 10 visits to Anfield, the last in the 2007 Champions League semi-final, but the implications of a fourth would be sizeable for both Manchester United and Liverpool. Defeat for United would leave them six points behind their fierce north-west rivals and encourage the portrayal of Mourinho as a manager left behind by the pressing instincts of Jürgen Klopp and co, despite being only eight league matches into his Old Trafford reign. Klopp has injury concerns, however, over two thirds of his central midfield in Adam Lallana and Georginio Wijnaldum. Andy Hunter	0	0.011598259210586548,0.9970732927322388
780	Arsenal	Middlesbrough	0	0	22/10/2016	17	What better present could Arsenal gift Arsène Wenger than three points and a seventh consecutive league win as he celebrates his 67th birthday on Saturday. Let alone the potential to claim top spot all for themselves. Meanwhile Middlesbrough are on a grim run of form having only won once from eight attempts. Aitor Karanka will have his work cut out to make his side believe they can stop Arsenal’s attacking force and spoil Wenger’s party. Graham Searles	0	-0.0003323853015899658,-0.0006904006004333496
781	Bournemouth	Tottenham Hotspur	0	0	22/10/2016	17	Bournemouth welcome Mauricio Pochettino’s side to a ground that has become something of a fortress recently. Eddie Howe’s team have recorded three consecutive home wins, although the size of the task ahead of them on Saturday needs no introduction. Bournemouth took the lead in the first minute but were humiliated 5-1 by Tottenham in this fixture last season, with Harry Kane scoring a hat-trick. Ben Fisher	0	0.5060191303491592,0
782	Burnley	Everton	2	1	22/10/2016	17	Burnley will be looking to replicate their 2-0 win over Liverpool when they come up against Everton. Despite an encouraging start to the season, it will be tough going against a Ronald Koeman’s side who seem rejuvenated following his appointment in the summer. The visitors are just two points off a Champions League place and boast one of the division’s form players in Romelu Lukaku. They have also won the past three league contests between the teams. Alex Bowmer	1	0.9702900946140289,0.002630859613418579
783	Hull City	Stoke City	0	2	22/10/2016	17	Mike Phelan’s pleasure at having his captain, Michael Dawson, available for the first time this season will have been tempered by the loss of Andrew Robertson for eight weeks with a thigh injury in last week’s disastrous 6-1 thrashing by Bournemouth. A broken kneecap sustained by Moses Odubajo in training means the Hull City manager may switch to a back three to compensate for a lack of available full-backs as he seeks to shore up the top flight’s leakiest defence.

784	Leicester City	Crystal Palace	3	1	22/10/2016	17	Last season’s champions have made a below-par start to their title defence but their Champions League campaign is going serenely. Palace currently lie ninth, having been boosted in the transfer window by the arrival of Christian Benteke. The corresponding fixture last season was settled by a Jamie Vardy winner, as he scored for the seventh successive Premier League game on his way to breaking Ruud van Nistelrooy’s record of 10.

785	Liverpool	West Brom	2	1	22/10/2016	17	With Liverpool’s sights raised this season Jürgen Klopp might not lead thechorus-line celebrations in front of the Kop should his team salvage a point in added time against Albion this time. “But everything is possible,” he admitted. The last three meetings between the teams have been drawn but, having defended Manchester United’s long balls on Monday, Klopp believes Liverpool are better equipped to deal with the Tony Pulis approach that caused him and his players such consternation last season. Adam Lallana is fit to start and improve the urgency and accuracy that was missing from Liverpool’s display against United. Andy Hunter	1	-0.30899818738301593,0.9976814985275269
786	Swansea City	Watford	0	0	22/10/2016	17	Swansea were the first side in the top flight to make a managerial change, dispensing with the services of Francesco Guidolin during the international break and appointing the experienced Bob Bradley in his place. There were plenty of encouraging signs for the American in his first game in charge, as his side narrowly lost to Arsenal. Watford have been exciting to watch going forward but look shaky in defence, while Etienne Capoue has been this season’s revelation, netting four goals in the opening eight games of the season.

787	West Ham United	Sunderland	1	0	22/10/2016	17	Sunderland’s search for their first league win of the season takes them to the London Stadium. Given that West Ham have been uncomfortable in their new home, this is a good opportunity for David Moyes’s strugglers. But Slaven Bilic, who is unsure when Andy Carroll will return after a setback in his recovery from a knee injury, will expect his side to build on last week’s win at Crystal Palace.

788	Chelsea	Manchester United	4	0	23/10/2016	17	The home support will bellow Matthew Harding’s name before kick-off in memory of the Chelsea vice-chairman, who died in a helicopter crash 20 years ago, though it will be José Mourinho who will be hogging the limelight. This is his first return to Stamford Bridge as manager of a rival Premier League club and many of those players who under-performed so badly last term will line up against his Manchester United side. “He deserves a good reception,” said Antonio Conte. “He is part of the story of this club.” Some of those on the pitch may have their own points to prove to the Portuguese. Dominic Fifield	1	0.992709755897522,0.8002175092697144
789	Manchester City	Southampton	1	1	23/10/2016	17	Pep Guardiola was eloquent and defiant in Friday’s pre-game press conference but the bottom line is if he follows Wednesday night’s 4-0 humiliation at Barcelona with a loss to Southampton he can expect a mini-inquiry into why his side have failed to win for five games. This might not be reasonable but in English football’s boom-and-bust culture it is just the way it is. Claude Puel’s side are unbeaten in the league since 10 September and up to eighth but it will still be a shock if the leaders are unable to defeat them. Jamie Jackson	0	0,0.3357069691022237
790	Crystal Palace	Liverpool	2	4	29/10/2016	17	Liverpool’s ascent to the upper echelons of the Premier League table has seen them go seven games unbeaten and score 16 goals in the process but their trip to SE25 may not be so straightforward. Palace have a strong record against them at Selhurst Park despite defeat last season and have won four of the last seven league matches there. But Alan Pardew will be hoping Jason Puncheon is fit to play – Palace have yet to win a league match without him since he signed in 2013. Ed Aarons	-1	0.03915923833847046,0.9852588176727295
791	Manchester United	Burnley	0	0	29/10/2016	17	Will the derby win over Manchester City be a turning point for José Mourinho and United? Perhaps, but anything less than a convincing win here would see the doom-merchants back out in force. Burnley may have recorded a couple of notable home scalps, against Liverpool and Everton, but they have struggled away from Turf Moor, conceding three in all three of their games on the road.

792	Middlesbrough	Bournemouth	2	0	29/10/2016	17	As his side seek their first home win since April, Aitor Karanka has a big decision to make. Does he keep faith with Adama Traoré, whose pace so unsettled Arsenal during last weekend’s 0-0 draw at the Emirates or recall the more tactically aware, positionally disciplined Stewart Downing? Perhaps he will find a way of accommodating both wingers while silencing those who suggested Aston Villa got the better deal when Traoré and Albert Adomah swapped clubs in August.

793	Sunderland	Arsenal	1	4	29/10/2016	17	With two points from their opening nine Premier League games, Sunderland have made the worst start to a top tier season since Sheffield Wednesday – (who had only one point at the same stage) – back in 1999-2000. Arsenal are probably the last team David Moyes would want to be facing as he strives to secure an elusive first league victory since succeeding Sam Allardyce in July but a crowd well in excess of 45,000 is expected to turn up to see him try. Its collective mood could prove influential. Louise Taylor	-1	-0.9997286200523376,0.9977166652679443
794	Tottenham Hotspur	Leicester City	1	1	29/10/2016	17	There was talk towards the end of last season about how Tottenham were coming for Leicester. Claudio Ranieri’s side waited and they waited, before wrapping up the title in relatively comfortable style. Their 1-0 win in this fixture last January had been a crucial result – on a night when Mauricio Pochettino was as animated as he has been in the White Hart Lane dug-out. Tottenham, who have made their best start to a Premier League season, are after a measure of revenge. David Hytner	0	-0.9448725879192352,0.012100577354431152
795	Watford	Hull City	1	0	29/10/2016	17	Daryl Janmaat could feature after overcoming a shoulder injury, as Watford try to maintain their positive start to the season. Hull are without a league win since August, and were dealt a huge blow with the loss of captain and top scorer Robert Snodgrass to an ankle injury in their 2-0 home defeat to Stoke. Mike Phelan has also lost striker Adama Diomandé, who was banned for violent conduct after Hull’s EFL Cup victory, Phelan’s first since becoming manager permanently, over Bristol City.

796	West Brom	Manchester City	0	4	29/10/2016	17	Tony Pulis will toast signing what, not too long ago, appeared to be an unlikely contract extension by looking to get one over Pep Guardiola, who will be desperate to avoid extending an already record winless streak to seven. Fortunately for City they have won nine of their past meetings against West Brom. But can a team lacking a cutting edge break down a notoriously rigid defensive unit?

797	Everton	West Ham United	2	0	30/10/2016	17	Ronald Koeman may have rectified the glaring weaknesses in Everton’s defending since replacing Roberto Martínez but the team continues to falter in the final third and has now gone five matches without a win. The early season confidence surrounding Everton has dispersed as a result and Slaven Bilic, by contrast, returns to Goodison Park in the belief West Ham’s season is improving following three consecutive victories. It might also be a relief to get away from the Olympic Stadium. Andy Hunter	1	-0.0029955804347991943,0.9829517006874084
798	Southampton	Chelsea	0	2	30/10/2016	17	Claude Puel continues to rotate to good effect as Southampton show themselves to be both solid and enterprising despite regular changes. Chelsea will have to excel, much like they did last weekend against Manchester United, to extend their three-game winning streak in the league. A lot could depend on how well the visitors’ wing-backs do against Southampton’s full-backs. Paul Doyle	-1	0.3420951763788859,0.9996635913848877
799	Stoke City	Swansea City	3	1	31/10/2016	17	Crisis, what crisis? You could not get great odds on Mark Hughes surviving the season after overseeing a limp 4-1 defeat at Crystal Palace in mid-September but Stoke, inspired by Joe Allen and Xherdan Shaqiri, have rallied since. A point at Old Trafford preceded comfortable wins against Sunderland and Hull; Stoke might well be expected to beat such opposition and the visit of Swansea seems similarly appetising. Victory for the visitors would be Bob Bradley’s first as manager, but what price Wilfried Bony will coming to the party and opening his account for Stoke against his old club?

Sunderland were in the vicinity only last week, after flying back to the north-east from Bournemouth airport after a poor performance against Southampton in the EFL Cup. A much-needed win would provide Moyes at least some respite. Bournemouth, meanwhile, will hope home comforts can see them return to winning ways, after an indifferent performance in defeat by Middlesbrough last time out.

801	Burnley	Crystal Palace	3	2	05/11/2016	17	Palace do little by halves but would not be too dissatisfied with a point at Turf Moor, arresting a recent slump that, allied with an upturn for Burnley, has brought the sides level on points. Sean Dyche’s defence rode out a storm at Old Trafford last week and have shown they will be intensely competitive. Their injury concerns are easing too and Dyche must decide whether to restore the fit-again Steven Defour to the midfield after a win and a draw in his absence.

802	Chelsea	Everton	5	0	05/11/2016	17	Antonio Conte’s Chelsea have revived with four successive Premier League wins and clean sheets but must now confront a player they had hoped to re-sign when Romelu Lukaku returns with Everton. The fees being quoted for the Belgian over the summer had been mind-boggling. As it is, he stayed at Goodison Park and Diego Costa is thriving again at Stamford Bridge. “Diego is not only scoring the goals but working a lot for the team,” said Conte of the division’s leading scorer to date this term. “I’m seeing a complete player in Diego.” Theirs will be an intriguing tête-à-tête.

803	Manchester City	Middlesbrough	1	1	05/11/2016	17	After Manchester City’s fine win over Barcelona, Middlesbrough may not relish a visit to an Etihad Stadium that is sure to be in good spirits as a result. Pep Guardiola’s side now appear over the hump of six games with no wins – a sequence that did not affect their status as leaders. Aitor Karanka’s side are a respectable 15th, three points above the drop zone. But it would represent a shock and setback for City should they lose on Saturday.

804	West Ham United	Stoke City	1	1	05/11/2016	17	All eyes will be on security at the London Stadium after the problems during West Ham United’s victory over Chelsea. But Slaven Bilic’s side also have problems on the pitch. They are 17th and face a Stoke side unbeaten in their past five matches. Stoke have concerns in attack, though, with Marko Arnautovic suspended and Xherdan Shaqiri doubtful because of a hamstring problem. Jacob Steinberg	0	-0.1757361888885498,-0.0029429495334625244
805	Arsenal	Tottenham Hotspur	1	1	06/11/2016	17	Mauricio Pochettino has to hope that the adage about form going out of the window on derby days rings true. Tottenham might be unbeaten in the Premier League but they have hit something of a wall in creative terms while Arsenal have goals in them and their tails up. Arsène Wenger has injury doubts over a clutch of players but he has selection headaches in a good way. The return of Harry Kane is a prominent sub-plot.

806	Hull City	Southampton	2	1	06/11/2016	17	Southampton could not hope for better opposition in Hull City, to ease tired legs, after taking revenge against Internazionale on Thursday night. Mike Phelan’s side have lost six successive league games and a good run in the EFL Cup is unlikely to lift spirits. However Phelan could be thrown a lifeline if Robert Snodgrass returns from injury, the Scot was instrumental in Hull’s early season triumphs. Graham Searles	1	0.0019259154796600342,0
807	Leicester City	West Brom	1	2	06/11/2016	17	Unbeaten in four matches in all competitions, Leicester are enjoying their best run of the season, yet are still some way short of their title-winning form. They will have to do without Kasper Schmeichel against West Brom after he fractured his hand against Copenhagen. Ron-Robert Zieler, Schmeichel’s deputy, can expect some sort of aerial assault against an Albion side without a win in five matches and reeling from last Saturday’s hammering at home to Manchester City.

808	Liverpool	Watford	6	1	06/11/2016	17	Jürgen Klopp insists Liverpool will respect a Watford side that have lost once on the road and kept three consecutive clean sheets, though he also knows his team have found solutions to most obstacles this season. The joint league leaders have not lost at Anfield since January and have won 12 and drawn three of their last 18 home matches; they are nine points better off than at the same stage last season. James Milner, Emre Can and Georginio Wijnaldum have all been ill this week but will be given until the last moment to recover. Andy Hunter	1	0.01774996519088745,0.9949434399604797
809	Swansea City	Manchester United	1	3	06/11/2016	17	Another away game for Manchester United and a chance for José Mourinho’s players to respond to the manager’s scathing criticism of their efforts against Fenerbahce. Swansea, on the face of it, should be benign opponents. They are second from bottom, without a victory since the opening day and have collected only two points from a possible 27, prompting Bob Bradley to describe keeping Swansea up as a “huge” job. Mourinho must feel the same way about turning United around. Stuart James	-1	-0.14943471550941467,0.7976965606212616
810	Crystal Palace	Manchester City	1	2	19/11/2016	17	Manchester City will hardly confront this game with much trepidation given Crystal Palace endured a miserable and pointless four-game streak between the autumn international breaks. The hosts are further hampered by the loss of Steve Mandanda to a knee injury but, while they are intent on resurgence, this will also be a sombre occasion. Tributes are to be paid to those who lost their lives in the Croydon tram derailment, with Palace and their players having made donations to the fund set up for the families involved.

811	Everton	Swansea City	1	1	19/11/2016	17	Bob Bradley has lamented the lack of leaders at Swansea, who are winless in their last 10 games, and it may deepen the sense of regret to see Ashley Williams in the opposition defence at Goodison Park. The Wales international faces his former club for the first time since his £12m move to Everton, who are also under pressure to react following a 5-0 mauling at Chelsea before the international break that manager Ronald Koeman described as “unacceptable in every aspect of football”.

812	Manchester United	Arsenal	1	1	19/11/2016	17	The fixture that brought us “the battle of the buffet”, Manchester United’s 8-2 win, and Arsène Wenger being sent to the Old Trafford stands (to name but a few memorable occasions) has gone a little quiet recently. José Mourinho and Wenger are hardly bosom buddies and United are desperate for the win to cut the deficit to Arsenal to three points, so maybe sparks will fly again. Jamie Jackson	0	-0.9737330675125122,0
813	Southampton	Liverpool	0	0	19/11/2016	17	Claude Puel has said he will not try to curb his team’s attacking intent in an effort to stifle the league leaders but he may have to adjust his team because of injuries. An array of players face late fitness tests before the game. That is far from ideal for the Frenchman, whose team already betrayed signs of wear and tear in their last game before the international break, a defeat at Hull. Yet Liverpool, who also have fitness worries, will know they will need to be close to their best to get the win that will ensure they remain top of the table. Paul Doyle	0	-0.9962522784868876,0.9893961548805237
814	Stoke City	Bournemouth	0	1	19/11/2016	17	Six games unbeaten have dispersed the cloud over Stoke caused by a slow start. Their revival coincided with the return of key players to fitness but there are several doubts for Bournemouth’s visit, although Xherdan Shaqiri and Marko Arnautovic return and it would take a brave punter to back an away win. Bournemouth have taken two points on the road and another slim return would drag them nearer to the relegation places. Eddie Howe believes they will soon be rewarded for the number of chances they are creating. Nick Ames	-1	-0.9726468324661255,0.3285234769185384
815	Sunderland	Hull City	3	0	19/11/2016	17	When David Moyes succeeded Sir Alex Ferguson as Manchester United manager he chose to ignore Ferguson’s advice and opted against retaining the services of Mike Phelan as assistant at Old Trafford. Hull’s manager may have forgiven his Sunderland counterpart but he almost certainly has not forgotten as their teams prepare for a game which surely offers a near perfect definition of the term “relegation six pointer”. With Will Keane out for the season and Abel Hernández injured, Hull lack attacking firepower and will be more dependent on Robert Snodgrass than ever. Louise Taylor	1	0,-0.0008926689624786377
816	Tottenham Hotspur	West Ham United	3	2	19/11/2016	17	Slaven Bilic was on the winning side when he made his West Ham debut in this fixture in 1996 and the manager is equally optimistic as they prepare to face England’s unbeaten team, albeit one who last won on 2 September, before the previous international break. “They are solid, they are electric,” Bilic said, “but we have improved and if we play good, we have a chance.” Mark Tallentire	1	0,0.9995774328708649
817	Watford	Leicester City	2	1	19/11/2016	17	Having been beaten at home by West Brom last time out Leicester will be looking to make amends on Saturday. Unfortunately for Claudio Ranieri’s side they face Watford, a team not only six places above them in the table but one looking to avenge their own humbling 6-1 defeat at the hands of Liverpool. Watford’s Walter Mazzarri insists his side should be “angry” but he will also be relieved that Heurelho Gomes has recovered quickly from a knee injury. Leicester, meanwhile, are still without Kasper Schmeichel, while Danny Drinkwater is 50/50 with a rib injury. Paul MacInnes	1	-0.025794774293899536,0.023147612810134888
818	Middlesbrough	Chelsea	0	1	20/11/2016	17	Aitor Karanka would relish celebrating his third anniversary of taking charge at The Riverside with a win. If Middlesbrough’s recent draws at Arsenal and Manchester City should make title chasing Chelsea suitably wary, they are likely to have to contend with the fit again Diego Costa and Eden Hazard. Ben Gibson’s duel with Costa promises to be an intriguing sub-plot as the visitors seek to emphasise their rebirth under Antonio Conte whose tactical joust with Karanka could be fascinating.

819	West Brom	Burnley	4	0	21/11/2016	17	Tony Pulis will have been disappointed the international break came just after West Bromwich ended their five-match winless run with three points at Leicester. However, Salomon Rondón’s return from injury should keep spirits high. Sean Dyche must share his counterpart’s sentiments but will be confident momentum lies with Burnley. An away victory might seem like child’s play to him compared to shutting out Manchester United at Old Trafford. Graham Searles	1	-0.9965865612030029,0.4196952184041341
820	Burnley	Manchester City	1	2	26/11/2016	17	Sean Dyche says Manchester City are in a “different world” to Burnley, but will want a reaction from his side after they made West Brom look extraterrestrial on Monday. Their 4-0 defeat continued some poor away form but at Turf Moor things are rather different and, having beaten Liverpool and Everton there as well as losing unfairly to Arsenal, they should make a fight of this one. Pep Guardiola may be considering Wednesday’s night Champions League away trip was not to have not been the best preparation for a Saturday lunchtime game against opponents who will not stop running.

821	Hull City	West Brom	1	1	26/11/2016	17	Hull’s failings, particularly in front of goal, were exposed by Sunderland last week and they remain hampered by injuries and beset by supporter unrest. They may have Andrew Robertson and Adama Diomandé back to face a West Brom side who were themselves the subject of grumbling from fans earlier in the season, but are in fine fettle after impressive wins over Leicester City and Burnley.

822	Leicester City	Middlesbrough	2	2	26/11/2016	17	With their place in the Champions League knockout stage secured, Leicester need to turn around their alarming domestic form to put to bed any more questions about relegation. Danny Drinkwater will be suspended for the visit of Middlesbrough, giving Andy King an opportunity to make a rare start. One point and one place behind Leicester, Aitor Karanka’s side also need the points and could do with a goal from Álvaro Negredo, who has not scored since the opening day of the season.

823	Liverpool	Sunderland	2	0	26/11/2016	17	Jürgen Klopp’s belief in staying grounded is well established but he was surely taking it too far when he proclaimed Sunderland favourites on account of their six points from the last two games compared to Liverpool’s four. “They are in their best moment of the season,” he added, and while that argument is not in dispute David Moyes, Victor Anichebe and other ex-Evertonians in the Sunderland ranks will have to excel to stifle a Liverpool side that have scored 17 goals in five home games. That equals Liverpool’s most prolific output since scoring 19 in five in 1980-81. Andy Hunter	1	0.9997738003730774,0
824	Swansea City	Crystal Palace	5	4	26/11/2016	17	A huge game for both clubs. Swansea are rock bottom of the table and without a victory since the opening day of the season. Crystal Palace, on the other hand, have lost their last five and travel to the Liberty Stadium with Alan Pardew, their manager, under growing pressure. Bob Bradley seems likely to stick with the same side that drew at Everton, so Gylfi Sigurdsson will play as a false No9. Joe Ledley could come back into contention for Palace.

825	Arsenal	Bournemouth	3	1	27/11/2016	17	Arsenal have once again stuttered in November as Arsène Wenger’s side have slipped from joint-top of the league in October to fourth. Victory is imperative against Bournemouth to produce a much-needed shot in the arm heading into the congested Christmas period. Eddie Howe will be the much more relaxed of the two managers, his side have exceeded expectation this season and, in only their third league meeting with Arsenal, would love to add to Wenger’s traditional autumnal woes.

826	Manchester United	West Ham United	1	1	27/11/2016	17	Manchester United are struggling to string a run of wins together since the three claimed at the start of the campaign. Given the close nature of the title race, a repeat of this could move José Mourinho’s side into the upper echelons. For West Ham even a single victory would be welcome: their last in the Premier League was over a month ago, when Sunderland were beaten 1-0 on 22 October.

827	Southampton	Everton	1	0	27/11/2016	17	A heavy defeat at Chelsea followed by a frustrating home draw with Swansea City means Ronald Koeman could do with a win on his return to St Mary’s with Everton. His successor at Southampton, Claude Puel, will hope that his team overcome their profligate streak. They need to start scoring more, as bad finishing jeopardised their Europa League campaign in mid-week and has cost them a lot of points in the Premier League this season.

828	Watford	Stoke City	0	1	27/11/2016	17	Stoke City arrive at Vicarage Road after a frustrating home defeat to Bournemouth. If Mark Hughes wants a strong reaction he can take inspiration from Watford who responded to a humiliating defeat at Liverpool by tearing into Leicester last week, going 2-0 up after 12 minutes. Walter Mazzarri reshaped his side for that match and Odion Ighalo looks likely to stay on the bench, such was the quality of Roberto Pereyra’s showing with Troy Deeney. Joe Allen is suspended for Stoke, while his midfield partner Glenn Whelan is doubtful with a calf problem. Paul MacInnes	-1	0.028732597827911377,-0.09536096453666687
829	Crystal Palace	Southampton	3	0	03/12/2016	17	The writing is on the wall for Alan Pardew. Crystal Palace go into this game on the back of six successive defeats, a run that has taken them to the brink of the relegation zone, with concerned owners considering the merits of Sam Allardyce, Chris Coleman, Roberto Mancini and Roy Hodgson as alternatives. Only victory will do but Southampton arrive buoyed by a fine display at Arsenal that has earned them a first League Cup semi-final in 30 years. Two years ago, their win at Selhurst Park cost Neil Warnock his job at Palace. History may be repeating itself. Dominic Fifield	1	0.9854389627774557,0.8337793548901876
830	Manchester City	Chelsea	1	3	03/12/2016	17	An age seems to have passed since Manchester City hammered Chelsea 3-0 in the corresponding fixture last season that featured John Terry being hauled off at half-time and which came in the wake of José Mourinho’s dispute with club doctor, Eva Carneiro. While that defeat proved an omen of the demise of Mourinho and his champions, Chelsea arrive as leaders and a point better off than City, which means a draw would be a fine result for them. Expect both teams, though, to go for what would be a statement victory. Jamie Jackson	-1	0.7839136123657227,0.9986151456832886
831	Stoke City	Burnley	2	0	03/12/2016	17	Stoke are now much closer to where they had expected to be and, although the injury list remains long, Mark Hughes has some welcome posers. Will he stick with the back three he selected against Watford, who were so successful last week? Will Joe Allen, in such fine form before suspension, come back into a side who dominated at Vicarage Road with a big contribution from the midfielder’s replacement, Giannelli Imbula? Sean Dyche will hope Hughes is blinded by his options: Burnley could do with something here after two consecutive defeats. Nick Ames	1	0.9996882677078247,-0.9601731896400452
832	Tottenham Hotspur	Swansea City	5	0	03/12/2016	17	Bob Bradley has finally generated the momentum he has craved and his head may still be spinning, in a good way, after last Saturday’s 5-4 win over Crystal Palace – his first in charge of Swansea. He comes to London with his team still in the relegation places but with renewed belief and ready to confront opponents who have lost some fluency over the past two months. For Tottenham, this feels like a must-win. David Hytner	1	0.9996486902236938,0.9987070858478546
833	West Brom	Watford	3	1	03/12/2016	17	Tony Pulis goes into the game £3.8m poorer having lost his case against Crystal Palace but focused on a first top-half finish with West Brom now ninth. He may have to cope without Salomón Rondón, sent home with tonsilitis, as Watford, a place higher and enjoying their best start since the mid-80s, seek more reward and with Troy Deeney after his 100th club goal.

834	West Ham United	Arsenal	1	5	03/12/2016	17	Both of these sides suffered midweek defeats in the EFL Cup but Arsenal will be confident of maintaining their title challenge. News that Santi Cazorla requires surgery on an ankle injury is a blow but Arsène Wenger’s side have not lost in the league since the opening day, while West Ham are a point above the bottom three.

835	Bournemouth	Liverpool	4	3	04/12/2016	17	Bournemouth face the unenviable task of a visit from high-flying Liverpool. Jürgen Klopp’s side are in dominant form, manifested in a 15-match unbeaten run in all competitions that the German will expect to be extended. However, without Philippe Coutinho to terrorise his defenders, Eddie Howe can find some solace. The focus for Bournemouth will be finding attacking flair of their own after scoring just three goals in five matches, since putting six past Hull in October.

836	Everton	Manchester United	1	1	04/12/2016	17	Form hardly indicates a quality affair at Goodison Park – the hosts have won once in eight league games, the visitors once in seven – but at least José Mourinho can draw confidence from a United team who are gradually clicking into shape and showed they do know where the goal is located in the midweek EFL Cup victory over West Ham. Ronald Koeman, in contrast, appears to be losing belief in the talent at his disposal by the week but insists “a lot of things can change on Sunday”. Andy Hunter	0	-0.9938071370124817,0
837	Middlesbrough	Hull City	1	0	05/12/2016	17	As encouraging as Middlesbrough’s recent performances have been they have still won only twice and are one point ahead of Hull. While Harry Maguire – a centre half coveted by Aitor Karanka – may have a chance to audition for a January move by marking Álvaro Negredo, the absence of Boro’s injured left-back George Friend could permit Robert Snodgrass to undermine the potentially vulnerable Fábio da Silva. Do not bet against Adama Traoré’s extraordinary pace and dribbling ability for Boro proving key though. Louise Taylor	1	0.4945332556962967,0
838	Arsenal	Stoke City	3	1	10/12/2016	17	Arsène Wenger has long demonstrated his capacity to respond to a setback but how he and Arsenal have done so after the EFL Cup exit to Southampton. They have taken apart West Ham and Basel and are determined to maintain the pressure on the leaders, Chelsea. Stoke, though, are in confident mood, having tightened up at the back and taken an impressive 18 points from 27. Could they get something at Arsenal for the first time since 1981?

839	Burnley	Bournemouth	3	2	10/12/2016	17	Burnley may come to be thankful of the small cushion their early-season form gave them. They have lost three games in a row for the first time this season and need to arrest the slump quickly; on the plus side they continue to impress at Turf Moor, running Manchester City mightily close two weeks ago, and Bournemouth will not inspire too much fear despite their remarkable comeback against Liverpool. Eddie Howe’s visitors could use that being the springboard for some consistency now, and victory should strengthen their position in the top half. Nick Ames	1	0.9972444772720337,0.06826871633529663
840	Hull City	Crystal Palace	3	3	10/12/2016	17	Crystal Palace arrive at Hull City following a morale-boosting 3-0 win against Southampton that ended their run of six straight defeats. No such respite for the hosts who have seen everything go downhill since their transfer embargo was lifted and they began signing players. Palace could do with another win but Hull are desperate with a tough run of fixtures coming up. Neither side are strong in defence but the visitors’ attack is significantly more threatening which could make for another tough afternoon for Mike Phelan.

841	Leicester City	Manchester City	4	2	10/12/2016	17	Manchester City have had an extra day to prepare for today’s late kick-off, after both sides’ underwhelming exploits in the Champions League.

843	Watford	Everton	3	2	10/12/2016	17	Watford have the chance to leapfrog Everton if they can turn around their blip in form. Ronald Koeman will hardly be confident he can foil Walter Mazzarri’s side. The visitors have won once in nine attempts since a run of four successive victories ended in September. To spark an upturn in fortunes Romelu Lukaku will have to start scoring more frequently, he has just one goal in his last six matches. Everton’s next top-scorer is Gareth Barry.

Last season West Ham recorded a league double over Liverpool for the first time since 1963-64, knocking Jürgen Klopp’s side out of the FA Cup too for good measure, but they return to Anfield without a win in six matches, one point above the relegation zone and with their manager under pressure following a humiliating 5-1 home defeat by Arsenal last weekend. Bilic needs a reaction, but so does Klopp following Liverpool’s collapse at Bournemouth. There is plenty at stake. Andy Hunter	0	-0.9935157001018524,-0.9895609617233276
846	Manchester United	Tottenham Hotspur	1	0	11/12/2016	17	The mood at Manchester United is one of frustration mixed with confidence that very soon everything will begin to click and performance will match result. Tottenham Hotspur are six points ahead of José Mourinho’s side in fifth place and given Mauricio Pochettino was of interest to United before hiring the Portuguese each man may have a little extra motivation to deliver three points.

847	Southampton	Middlesbrough	1	0	11/12/2016	17	It has been an awful week for Southampton. A heavy defeat at Crystal Palace was followed by elimination from the Europa League and a serious injury to Charlie Austin, the only player who has scored regularly for the club this season. Middlesbrough have lost only one match away in the league this season and will feel confident of adding to Claude Puel’s woes. Paul Doyle	1	-0.9986332952976227,0.9987210631370544
848	Crystal Palace	Chelsea	0	1	17/12/2016	17	Chelsea, resplendent at the top, will fancy their chances of equalling their club record of 11 league wins in succession given Crystal Palace’s fraught campaign. The hosts have the joint worst home record in the division and are undermined by injuries, with Alan Pardew still a manager very much under pressure. It is doubtful a mooted fan protest will amount to much but there is local disquiet after a wretched league year, and a squad reduced to 13 fit senior outfield players will do well to contain the visitors. Dominic Fifield	-1	-0.9927253723144531,0.9994086027145386
849	Middlesbrough	Swansea City	3	0	17/12/2016	17	With a tally of just 13 goals in 16 games, Middlesbrough are the Premier League’s lowest scorers and there will be reason for anxiety on Teesside should Aitor Karanka’s shot shy side struggle to break down Swansea’s generous defence. This latest relegation six pointer represents the start of a potentially season-defining run of, on paper at least, winnable games for Swansea whose next four fixtures pit Bob Bradley’s side against West Ham, Bournemouth, Crystal Palace and Hull. Louise Taylor	1	-0.9952226281166077,0.9854105710983276
850	Stoke City	Leicester City	2	2	17/12/2016	17	A point from their last two games has checked Stoke’s rise and they will be without Marko Arnautovic over most of the Christmas period after his red card in the draw with Southampton. They are, at least, well stocked in attack and Mame Biram Diouf or Wilfried Bony will come in. Leicester would just like consistency: they lost 1-0 at Bournemouth on Tuesday – some anticlimax after their heroics against Manchester City. Nick Ames	0	0.029711037874221802,-0.8601813316345215
851	Sunderland	Watford	1	0	17/12/2016	17	David Moyes could have done without Younes Kaboul’s summer-time switch to Watford and a defender who was integral in last season’s survival should probably brace himself for a somewhat frosty Wearside reception if he features. With Sunderland’s January transfer coffers bare, this season’s relegation fight will be all about making do and mending for Moyes whose attempt to lift his team out of the mire would be enhanced if they could start scoring from set pieces. The big problem is that Wahbi Khazri and Sebastian Larsson, his two dead-ball specialists, are merely substitutes these days. Louise Taylor	1	0.9608588218688965,0.003953099250793457
852	West Brom	Manchester United	0	2	17/12/2016	17	West Brom are the surprise package of the Premier League this season. It may sound unbelievable but Tony Pulis, frequently maligned for negative tactics, has his side playing with attacking verve and as a result they have scored one more goal than Manchester United in the league leaving them one place behind the visitors in seventh. However José Mourinho is unlikely to be fearful and will have the utmost faith that his improving side can take the spoils. Graham Searles	-1	0.9990751445293427,0.998881995677948
853	West Ham United	Hull City	1	0	17/12/2016	17	West Ham United are feeling better after picking up four points from their past two games and the visit of Hull City offers them a chance to edge away from the bottom three. After beating Burnley on Wednesday, they will be confident of finally recording consecutive wins in the league at the London Stadium. Andy Carroll is set to start again for Slaven Bilic’s side, who could condemn Hull to spending Christmas at the bottom of the table. Jacob Steinberg	1	0.9993570148944855,0.990100085735321
854	Bournemouth	Southampton	1	3	18/12/2016	17	This could not be better for Bournemouth, with local rivals Southampton in town, as Eddie Howe’s side go in search of consecutive wins for the first time this season. They are level on points but Claude Puel’s side sit narrowly ahead of Bournemouth on goal difference. This is only their 24th meeting and for now it remains low-key. “The more games we play against Southampton the more the rivalry will grow,” Howe said on Friday. “It’s something we’re looking forward to.” Ben Fisher	-1	0.9914832413196564,-0.004351317882537842
855	Manchester City	Arsenal	2	1	18/12/2016	17	Pep Guardiola and Arsène Wenger: two managers whose pass-pass-attack ethos is about as identical as can be expected so this match should fascinate. A point and a position separates Manchester City from Arsenal, in fourth and third respectively. And as City have not beaten the visitors since a 6-3 walloping three years ago, a victory for them would be particularly satisfying. One outcome seems certain – this will not be a goalless draw. Jamie Jackson	1	0.999546468257904,-0.9822641015052795
856	Tottenham Hotspur	Burnley	2	1	18/12/2016	17	Burnley arrive at White Hart Lane with one goal and one point from seven away matches and few people expecting them to improve their record against a Tottenham side that have recovered a little rhythm after the disappointment of their Champions League exit. But Burnley had their moments in defeat at West Ham United on Wednesday and they revel in confounding the doubters. As Sean Dyche almost said on Friday, aren’t they supposed to be down already? David Hytner	1	0,0.25927217801411945
857	Everton	Liverpool	0	1	19/12/2016	17	The rivals approach the 227th Merseyside derby with morale lifted by important victories in midweek while also anxious to avoid a defeat that would ruin Christmas for one half of the city. Everton, who will be without the suspended captain, Phil Jagielka, are unbeaten at home in the Premier League this season but have not won any of the last 12 derbies. For all the scrutiny on their defence, Liverpool have kept four clean sheets in their last six matches and Jürgen Klopp will hope Joël Matip recovers from an ankle injury for their first experience of Goodison Park. Andy Hunter	-1	-0.6541525721549988,0.9961444437503815
858	Arsenal	West Brom	1	0	26/12/2016	17	Arsenal’s slide from top to fourth in the space of eight days has led to familiar questions and, with them nine points off the pace, the prediction their title hopes are over. The Law of Wenger dictates they will bounce back against a West Brom team who, apart from their tired showing against Manchester United last Saturday, have been in resurgent form. The alternative is a whole lot of wailing. David Hytner	1	-0.9894106984138489,0.9961620569229126
859	Burnley	Middlesbrough	1	0	26/12/2016	17	This may be a defining period for Burnley, who have lost five in six but tend to let opponents know they have been in a game. Back-to-back wins over Middlesbrough and Sunderland cannot be discounted given their impressive home form, and might also help Sean Dyche attract the right January reinforcements. Their first festive test sees a rematch with last season’s Championship rivals Boro, with whom they shared a draw at Turf Moor in April. Aitor Karanka’s side, who cut loose all of a sudden in overwhelming Swansea, would consider a repeat of that a reasonable enough return this time too. Nick Ames	1	0.9868884682655334,0.9737095534801483
860	Chelsea	Bournemouth	3	0	26/12/2016	17	Antonio Conte must decide whether Michy Batshuayi is ready to start his first Premier League game in place of the suspended Diego Costa, with Cesc Fàbregas drafted into midfield, or if he must juggle his attacking resources to secure a club record 12th successive victory. The Italian will be aware that Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth won in south-west London last season, albeit while José Mourinho’s tenure was unravelling, and they will be awkward opponents. This will provide a test of sorts of the depth of Chelsea’s squad ahead of the transfer window. Dominic Fifield	1	-0.03597882390022278,-0.9640881419181824
861	Hull City	Manchester City	0	3	26/12/2016	17	Manchester City may have one eye on their New Year’s Eve fixture against Liverpool when they arrive in Hull. And who can blame them? Without being disrespectful, Mike Phelan’s side should offer the chance for Pep Guardiola to test tactics and prepare for Sergio Agüero’s return at Anfield. Bottom-club Hull will be hoping for a Christmas miracle in order to salvage a result. Graham Searles	-1	0.006957799196243286,0.9799895882606506
862	Leicester City	Everton	0	2	26/12/2016	17	Leicester City will have resented the nine-day wait to face Everton after their superb 10-man comeback against Stoke. Claudio Ranieri needs his side to pick up from where they left off to earn three points that would ensure not falling into the relegation zone before the new year. However the ill discipline of Jamie Vardy, Robert Huth and Christian Fuchs could cost them against an Everton side in the mood to avenge their excruciating derby defeat. Graham Searles	-1	-0.9306763410568237,-0.9910753965377808
863	Manchester United	Sunderland	3	1	26/12/2016	17	Given the season it would be heartening to witness David Moyes receive a warm reception from Manchester United fans on his first return to Old Trafford since his sacking two years ago. This is as far as goodwill can extend of course as on the field the supporters only wish to see Sunderland beaten to make it four consecutive Premier League victories for José Mourinho’s side. Jamie Jackson	1	0.991631805896759,-0.9676598310470581
864	Swansea City	West Ham United	1	4	26/12/2016	17	West Ham can record a third successive victory for the first time this season against Swansea and Slaven Bilic will be confident his side can prevail. If other results go their way Bilic’s side could climb into the top half of the Premier League table. However, Bob Bradley will have watched the footage from West Ham’s past two wins and will see a side that is beatable, despite Swansea’s lowly standing – fans voted for the post to be man of the match at the London Stadium against Hull after it saved the home side three times. Graham Searles	-1	0.9978845715522766,0.9877339800198873
865	Watford	Crystal Palace	1	1	26/12/2016	17	There could be worse places for Sam Allardyce to take charge of his first game as Crystal Palace manager – his new club have a remarkable record at Vicarage Road having won six times and lost only once in their past 10 league visits. Walter Mazzarri’s Christmas wish must surely be for Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo to find form – the pair have four league goals between them so far compared to 16 at this point last season. Rich Flower	0	0.9914607405662537,0.9974855184555054
866	Liverpool	Stoke City	4	1	27/12/2016	17	The stoppage time win at Everton felt like a defining three points for Jürgen Klopp’s team but they need to maintain pressure on Chelsea over the festive period to confirm as much. Liverpool have never lost a top-flight league game at home to Stoke – a sequence stretching back 53 games – although Mark Hughes’s team were the last to win at Anfield in the League Cup back in January. Joe Allen leads a strong ex-Liverpool contingent back at their old club. Andy Hunter	1	0.3359753092130025,0
867	Southampton	Tottenham Hotspur	1	4	28/12/2016	17	A punishing schedule of three matches in six days would suggest Southampton have somehow got themselves on the Premier League fixture computer’s naughty list this year. Claude Puel’s side will benefit from the 10-day break since their 3-1 win at Bournemouth but they risk losing the momentum generated by that impressive performance just as they head into a crucial run of fixtures. Rich Flower	-1	-0.33210839827855426,0
868	Burnley	Sunderland	4	1	31/12/2016	17	Burnley have won four of their past five home games and, if victorious against Sunderland, could end the year in the top half of the table. The absence of Jordan Pickford, Sunderland’s breakout star of 2016, may help them as Vito Mannone could be rusty after not featuring since 21 August. David Moyes and Sunderland, however, are no strangers to adversity and will be fired up by the possibility of climbing out of the relegation zone. Graham Searles	1	0.997352808713913,-0.9973717331886292
869	Chelsea	Stoke City	4	2	31/12/2016	17	Antonio Conte was dismissive of Arsène Wenger’s suggestion that the title is already Chelsea’s to lose, but will face Stoke seeking a 13th successive league win and conscious that his team are favourites. “I’m pleased if people are changing their opinions (of us),” he said. “But that means you must pay even more attention.” Standards must not slip here. Stoke drew at Stamford Bridge and twice triumphed at home against the Londoners last term. They represent distinctly awkward opposition. Dominic Fifield	1	-0.9524317979812622,0.33088352282842
870	Leicester City	West Ham United	1	0	31/12/2016	17	West Ham arrive with nine points from nine while Leicester are looking to finish off the year in which they won the title with a win to stay out of the bottom three. “Considering where they were four seasons ago, it’s quite a normal situation for them,” said Slaven Bilic. To that end, City are helped by the returns from suspension of Robert Huth and Christian Fuchs. Mark Tallentire	1	0.9793806672096252,0.9953480362892151
871	Liverpool	Manchester City	1	0	31/12/2016	17	Undoubtedly the Christmas cracker of a festive program lacking in high-profile encounters. Liverpool and Manchester City do battle for second place. Both sides are so evenly matched, explosive in attack and liable to blunders at the back, that a coin toss might be the most effective way of choosing the victor. Sergio Agüero may disagree, the Argentinian will be eager to test the frequently error-prone Simon Mignolet with a thunderbolt or two. Graham Searles	1	-0.3237544099489848,0
872	Manchester United	Middlesbrough	2	1	31/12/2016	17	If Manchester United beat Middlesbrough this will be a fifth successive Premier League win for José Mourinho’s in-form side. Two seasons have passed since United last did the same number. In the sole golden run under Louis van Gaal, the February-April period of the 2014-15 season, United won six consecutive league games and offered an outside chance of the title before defeat at Chelsea, the eventual champions. The manager of the west Londoners then? Mourinho. Jamie Jackson	1	0.9225239604711533,0.9837904572486877
873	Southampton	West Brom	1	2	31/12/2016	17	This match – along with Southampton’s duel with Everton on 2 January – will have a bearing on which side collects the notional ‘best of the rest’ award at the end of the season for finishing just below the Premier League title-chasers. Southampton are likely to have most of the ball against West Brom but Claude Puel’s side are still struggling to find sharpness so the well organised visitors will fancy their chances of pinching a win. Paul Doyle	-1	0.9977453052997589,0
874	Swansea City	Bournemouth	0	3	31/12/2016	17	There was only one good thing to say about the Bob Bradley experiment: when the end came, it was swift. However, the hope that things on the pitch will change for Swansea is hampered by the fact Alan Curtis, the caretaker manager, does not have much to choose from beyond the players who lost so pitifully against West Ham on Boxing Day. Bournemouth will hope to profit. Conrad Leach	-1	-0.9997554421424866,0.9467368125915527
875	Everton	Southampton	3	0	02/01/2017	17	Ronald Koeman endured a miserable return to St Mary’s Stadium in November when his current side were outmanoeuvred and beaten by his old one but fatigue may work in Everton’s favour this time around. Ludicrously, Southampton are playing for the third time in six days and Claude Puel has admitted it will be a struggle to juggle his resources at Goodison Park. Tom Davies, sharp as a substitute at Hull City on Friday, may get a chance to start in Everton’s midfield, with Koeman keen to protect Gareth Barry from two games in quick succession. Andy Hunter	1	0.02880921959877014,-0.983163058757782
876	Manchester City	Burnley	2	1	02/01/2017	17	The pass-and-move masters that were Manchester City in their 10 consecutive wins at the start of the season now seem a mirage. The most troubling element of Saturday’s 1-0 defeat at Liverpool was that it was no surprise. Pep Guardiola’s side have been misfiring for a while despite the three wins on the bounce beforehand. Can Burnley turn them over at the Etihad? Sean Dyche’s side are 11th and have won their past two games, so this is another test for City. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.9937660694122314,-0.9864514172077179
877	Middlesbrough	Leicester City	0	0	02/01/2017	17	Claudio Ranieri will want to see Leicester City capitalise on their solid win over West Ham. The Italian should be especially keen because this is the last game for which Islam Slimani and Riyad Mahrez will be available before leaving for the Africa Cup of Nations. Middlesbrough’s scoring average of fewer than one goal a game will not worry their opponents, who need to improve in 2017. Graham Searles	0	0.995192289352417,0.9971379935741425
878	Sunderland	Liverpool	2	2	02/01/2017	17	Liverpool have won their past four matches, the most recent of which was against Manchester City. Sunderland are in poor form and lost 4-1 at Burnley last time out. There should, then, be only one winner. But with the visitors having less than 44 hours to prepare for this game and possibly lacking Jordan Henderson through injury, the hosts may sense they can cause an upset.

879	West Brom	Hull City	3	1	02/01/2017	17	Both these sides ended 2016 with encouraging results, although the fact West Bromwich managed to win 2-1 at Southampton but Hull were pegged back by Everton to draw 2-2 tells the story of their respective seasons. Tony Pulis’s side are riding high in eighth place and will look to consolidate that today, whereas Hull, in 19th, know they need to start winning soon if an instant return to the Championship is to be avoided.

880	West Ham United	Manchester United	0	2	02/01/2017	17	Manchester United head to the London Stadium after five straight victories and unbeaten in their last 12 matches. How José Mourinho would love to continue 2017 in a similar vein with a sixth. However, he will be without Eric Bailly, who has joined up with his Ivory Coast team-mates before the Africa Cup of Nations while Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney are both doubts. West Ham, who lost at Leicester City on Saturday, may be without the captain Mark Noble. Ben Fisher	-1	-0.9822161197662354,0.9918214678764343
881	Bournemouth	Arsenal	3	3	03/01/2017	17	Bournemouth brushed aside Swansea City on New Year’s Eve and return to home soil hoping to close out a team at the opposite end of the table, Arsenal. Benik Afobe, in particular, will have been lifted by getting on the scoresheet at the Liberty Stadium before facing his former club. The on-loan Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere, though, is ineligible to play against his parent club, with Arsène Wenger hopeful of a second win in three days.

882	Crystal Palace	Swansea City	1	2	03/01/2017	17	Guiding Swansea to a 5-4 win in November’s madcap reverse fixture did not make much of a difference for the then manager, Bob Bradley – he was sacked only five days after the losing side dispensed with the services of Alan Pardew. Defeat at Selhurst Park on Monday will not cost Sam Allardyce his job but it would put Palace in danger of slipping into the mire. Rich Flower	-1	0.0006836354732513428,-0.9993360638618469
883	Stoke City	Watford	2	0	03/01/2017	17	There has been little festive cheer for Stoke after the fixture computer handed them trips to Anfield and Stamford Bridge in between Christmas and new year and despite flattering to deceive before losing both games, the visit of Watford gives them a chance to end on a high. Sunday’s home humbling by Spurs was a fifth defeat in seven for Walter Mazzarri’s inconsistent side. Paul Chronnell	1	0.9985389709472656,-0.998100221157074
884	Tottenham Hotspur	Chelsea	2	0	04/01/2017	17	Mauricio Pochettino has referenced his Tottenham side’s performance at Stamford Bridge on 26 November as a turning point of sorts in the season. They had been positive for the first 45 minutes and the manager felt that it showed they were over their Champions League exit. But they still lost, as everybody has done to Chelsea in the league over the past three months. Tottenham are in form and this could be wild. Can they stop the Chelsea juggernaut?

885	Burnley	Southampton	1	0	14/01/2017	17	Only Chelsea and Tottenham have won more league games at home this season than Burnley so Southampton face a tall order at Turf Moor, especially as Claude Puel’s side are still struggling in front of goal. Former Burnley player Jay Rodriguez will be hoping to put that right to end a miserable run of three consecutive league defeats. Graham Searles	1	-0.9988952279090881,0
886	Hull City	Bournemouth	3	1	14/01/2017	17	Marco Silva takes charge of his first Premier League match hoping for a miracle with his team bottom. Abel Hernández, last season’s top scorer, who has missed half of Hull’s league matches, is fit and the new arrival Oumar Niasse could also feature. Bournemouth will also have fresh legs, having rested their entire team for the embarrassing FA Cup defeat against Millwall.

887	Leicester City	Chelsea	0	3	14/01/2017	17	It was this fixture last season that spelt the end for José Mourinho at Chelsea as Leicester returned to top spot in a sign of things to come. Thirteen months on and the normal order has been restored as Leicester languish in the bottom half and Chelsea lead the way, yet Claudio Ranieri’s side have a chance to upset the apple cart. Jamie Vardy returns for Leicester after recovering from illness, with Nathan Aké set to replace the suspended John Terry in Chelsea’s squad. Stuart James	-1	0.8424952328205109,0.998124897480011
888	Sunderland	Stoke City	1	3	14/01/2017	17	Stoke have a poor record on Wearside but Mark Hughes will be hoping to return to winning ways after last week’s disappointing 2-0 home FA Cup defeat to Wolves. Already underwhelmed by what is turning into a slog of a league campaign, Stoke fans were seriously unhappy about that reverse and Hughes knows a correction is needed. Sunderland remain desperate to secure a win that seems near essential to sustaining David Moyes’s hopes of escaping relegation. Louise Taylor	-1	0.9958263039588928,-0.006179243326187134

While the good news for Arsenal is that Mesut Özil is back after illness, Hector Bellerín and Francis Coquelin are among a long list of absentees. Swansea have their own problems, with Neil Taylor and new signing Luciano Narsingh ruled out. Arsenal’s Olivier Giroud, who has scored in his past four matches, could be the man to watch.

890	Tottenham Hotspur	West Brom	4	0	14/01/2017	17	Mauricio Pochettino has Tottenham flying. They have six straight wins in all competitions and are playing the sort of football that took them close to the title last season. But West Brom are something of a bogey team and it was Tottenham’s failure to beat them at the end of last season that effectively derailed their title challenge.

891	Watford	Middlesbrough	0	0	14/01/2017	17	The result will be of secondary importance to Watford after the death of Graham Taylor. They will, however, hope to arrest a slide that has secured only one point from five matches. The loan signing Tom Cleverley could start, while Heurelho Gomes and José Holebas return from illness. Middlesbrough will miss Gaston Ramírez but the £6m striker Rudy Gestede could make his debut. Paul MacInnes	0	0.8870081305503845,0.989163875579834
892	West Ham United	Crystal Palace	3	0	14/01/2017	17	Sam Allardyce may fancy his chances of securing his first win as the Crystal Palace manager when he faces his old side. West Ham United have been rocked by Dimitri Payet’s request to leave and the France midfielder will be a notable absentee at the London Stadium. Palace are a point above the bottom three but they could drag Slaven Bilic’s inconsistent side back into the mire. Jacob Steinberg	1	-0.9914376139640808,0.3317115902900696
893	Everton	Manchester City	4	0	15/01/2017	17	Pep Guardiola’s last visit to Merseyside ended in defeat and recrimination at Anfield on New Year’s Eve, although that was the only game in the last six that Manchester City have failed to win. Guardiola’s side were on top form at West Ham United and Ronald Koeman said City could repeat that 5-0 FA Cup win should Everton reproduce the feeble defensive display that led to them being knocked out of the competition by Leicester City last weekend.

894	Manchester United	Liverpool	1	1	15/01/2017	17	Manchester United’s morale is high but they started the weekend 10 points behind Chelsea, so José Mourinho’s men need to win to have a chance of taking the title.

895	Bournemouth	Watford	2	2	21/01/2017	17	Bournemouth’s preoccupation with the number three will concern Eddie Howe, having conceded that many in five of their last six games.

The visitors have injuries and absences and are skirting with trouble, winless in the league since 10 December and with only two goals in six games.

896	Crystal Palace	Everton	0	1	21/01/2017	17	Any optimistic Crystal Palace supporters buoyed by a rare midweek win in the FA Cup will be wary that a dreadlocked Andy Preece scored Crystal Palace’s last winner against Everton at Selhurst Park, and that was almost 23 years ago. The current side have not even managed a goal when welcoming these opponents in this latest four-year stint in the top flight, which makes this fixture a daunting prospect. Sam Allardyce would have liked more additions than just Jeffrey Schlupp to throw in for a home debut. These are troubling times. Dominic Fifield	-1	-0.5049788653850555,0
897	Liverpool	Swansea City	2	3	21/01/2017	17	Liverpool have not lost a league game at Anfield in over a year and maintaining their impressive home form will be key to fulfilling dreams of the title. Jürgen Klopp’s side have scored 26 goals in nine home league games and host a Swansea side that have kept only one clean sheet in 13 games. New recruits Martin Olsson and Tom Carroll could debut for Paul Clement’s visitors but a third, Dutch winger Luciano Narsingh, is doubtful with a calf injury. Andy Hunter	-1	0.11455053091049194,-0.9946119785308838
898	Manchester City	Tottenham Hotspur	2	2	21/01/2017	17	Pep Guardiola has already conceded the Premier League title race and what might he say if Manchester City go down to Tottenham Hotspur at their own ground about hopes of Champions League qualification? They would not be out of it, of course, but it would add to the questions hovering over Guardiola’s side. Only an impressive defeat of Spurs might answer them but given the visitors’ form this seems unlikely. Jamie Jackson	0	-0.951849102973938,-0.9762998223304749
899	Middlesbrough	West Ham United	1	3	21/01/2017	17	Aitor Karanka has warned his defence about the threat posed by Andy Carroll. “He’s an amazing player,” said Middlesbrough’s manager. “He’s a player we have to be careful of. We need to try to stop him, to stop the balls to him.” Expert at securing goalless draws, Boro are only four points above the relegation zone and have scored just 17 times in 21 league games. Patrick Bamford, newly signed from Chelsea for £6m, hopes to improve such statistics but will begin on the bench. Louise Taylor	-1	0.11226449693952288,0
900	Stoke City	Manchester United	1	1	21/01/2017	17	For a team that failed to win in their first nine league games of the campaign, Stoke have staged a great recovery to sit in ninth place after 21 matches. Manchester United will offer a stern test for Mark Hughes’s side and although the visitors’ run of nine straight wins in all competitions was ended by last week’s draw with Liverpool, they are still favourites to avenge the 2-0 defeat they suffered here in December 2015.

901	West Brom	Sunderland	2	0	21/01/2017	17	Sunderland, hit more than most by Africa Cup of Nations call-ups, hope to arrest a run of four winless matches against topsy-turvy West Brom. Yet despite last Saturday’s dismantling by Spurs the hosts are worthy of a top eight place and buoyed by a versatile signing in Jake Livermore. Jermain Defoe will hope Gareth McAuley retains jitters from White Hart Lane. Stuart Goodwin	1	0.9996368885040283,0.9741412699222565
902	Arsenal	Burnley	2	1	22/01/2017	17	Arsenal welcome back Hector Bellerín for Burnley’s visit to the Emirates as Arsène Wenger’s number of injured players dwindles. The Frenchman will be delighted by the prospect of having many more options at his disposal. Sean Dyche’s side have taken one point away from home this season in nine matches and have conceded 20 goals. Alexis Sánchez has all the motivation he needs.

903	Chelsea	Hull City	2	0	22/01/2017	17	Antonio Conte has time yet to determine whether Diego Costa has proved himself enough in training this week to start against Hull City, but he will resist the striker’s availability becoming a distraction. Chelsea play last of the title contenders and will be hoping to extend their lead at the top this weekend. “But our challenge is to keep the right concentration,” said the Italian. “If you think this game is easy, you make a great mistake and you can pay for this mistake at the end of the season.” He will be wary of ‘new coach bounce’.

904	Southampton	Leicester City	3	0	22/01/2017	17	Southampton dominated proceedings against Leicester when these sides met in October but had to settle for a 0-0 draw because of poor finishing, a recurring problem this season. Claudio Ranieri’s side need to do better this time in order to hoist themselves further clear of the relegation zone and they may be helped by Southampton preparing for their EFL Cup semi-final second leg against Liverpool on Wednesday. Paul Doyle	1	-0.00921165943145752,0
905	Chelsea	Arsenal	3	1	04/02/2017	17	Antonio Conte was keen to preach caution, insisting “if someone thinks the league is finished, I’m not so sure”, but Arsenal surely know their title pursuit is dependent on winning at Stamford Bridge. That damaging defeat to Watford has left Arsène Wenger’s side forlorn. They are hampered too by Chelsea’s eagerness to avenge that humiliation endured at the Emirates in September. They have been virtually untouchable ever since. Dominic Fifield	1	-0.9988155364990234,-0.9908573031425476
906	Crystal Palace	Sunderland	0	4	04/02/2017	17	Having secured his first league win as the Crystal Palace manager at Bournemouth in midweek, Sam Allardyce will be desperate to repeat the trick against his former employers. Sunderland need the points even more, with four points between them and Premier League safety, despite the creditable home draw against Tottenham. Expect a nerve-shredding match at Selhurst Park for all. Ed Aarons	-1	-0.9922839105129242,-0.7121545672416687
907	Everton	Bournemouth	6	3	04/02/2017	17	Everton have crept up the table and are seventh, having last been defeated on 19 December. The same cannot be said about Bournemouth who looked poor against Crystal Palace in midweek and are drifting towards the relegation zone. To make matters worse they are without Callum Wilson, who ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in training. Dan Brown	1	0.994522213935852,-0.34299182891845703
908	Hull City	Liverpool	2	0	04/02/2017	17	There was no evidence of transfer upheaval or lack of confidence impacting on Hull when they climbed off the bottom of the Premier League with a draw at Manchester United in midweek. A repeat performance, particularly in defence, will be in order when Liverpool visit with the aim of putting their January slump behind them. Sadio Mané, Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana all scored in the 5-1 defeat of Hull at Anfield in September and Jürgen Klopp finally has a full range of attacking options at his disposal again. Andy Hunter	1	-0.999629020690918,0.09738212823867798
909	Southampton	West Ham United	1	3	04/02/2017	17	Southampton can be satisfied to have received £8m for a 33-year-old centre-back who was minded to move on but when José Fonte returns to St Mary’s with West Ham, the home club may wish they had been able to hold on to him a little longer. Virgil van Dijk’s injury leaves Claude Puel with few central defensive options. But if Saints manage to plug the gap at the back and take their chances up front they could still have the last laugh. Paul Doyle	-1	-0.5015213191509247,0
910	Tottenham Hotspur	Middlesbrough	1	0	04/02/2017	17	Tottenham have stumbled slightly, having previously flexed their muscles in the title race and they will consider this game as one in which to get back on track. Aitor Karanka’s Middlesbrough do not give much away – particularly on their Premier League travels, where only Chelsea and Tottenham have conceded fewer goals. But Mauricio Pochettino’s team have come to look imposing at home and they back themselves to cut loose against anyone. David Hytner	1	-0.8334735035896301,-0.9955751895904541
911	Watford	Burnley	2	1	04/02/2017	17	Watford, who had looked like spiralling into chaos after a disastrous run of league form and an FA Cup exit to Millwall, now host Burnley on the back of the most unlikely away win of the season at Arsenal. Any away win for Burnley would be unlikely as they are still stuck on just the one point gained away from Turf Moor all season. They will be missing Steven Defour with a hamstring injury but have both their deadline-day signings in Robbie Brady and Ashley Westwood ready for action. Watford will assess Miguel Britos and will be tempted to give the forward M’Baye Niang his second start in five days. Paul MacInnes	1	0.8013693988323212,-0.79800084233284
912	West Brom	Stoke City	1	0	04/02/2017	17	“I’ve spent two and a half years at this club and he’s not my problem anymore. I wish him all the best.” These were the words spoken by Tony Pulis on Saido Berahino – the pantomime villain of The Hawthorns after his overdue departure. But, should Berahino enter from stage left for his full Stoke debut, it promises to be a better contest than many may think. Just four points split the sides, who are eighth and ninth respectively. Dan Brown	1	-0.8987324833869934,0.8289777835210165
913	Leicester City	Manchester United	0	3	05/02/2017	17	The last time José Mourinho visited the King Power Stadium, in December 2015, he was sacked the following day. That was during his time in charge of Chelsea, when Leicester were on their way to winning the title. It seems like a distant memory now, and it is Ranieri, not Mourinho, who goes into this game under pressure. Depending on results elsewhere, Leicester could be in the bottom three by the time they kick off. United need a win to break a run of three draws. Stuart James	-1	-0.498920738697052,-0.9273892045021057
914	Manchester City	Swansea City	2	1	05/02/2017	17	Will Pep Guardiola drop Sergio Agüero and Claudio Bravo for a second match in a row? Can the Manchester City manager somehow plot his way to a third win over Swansea City this season? The first question comes after the striker and the No1 keeper were left out for the 4-0 win at West Ham United. The second because Guardiola talked up Paul Clement’s impact since taking over four games ago. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.9980930685997009,0
915	Arsenal	Hull City	2	0	11/02/2017	17	Here we go again. Arsène Wenger can hear the squeals of protest and the problem of whether he ought to stay on at Arsenal dominates the agenda. Wenger only ever seems to be one defeat from crisis. The team have now lost two on the spin and the consequences of another bad result against a Hull team revitalised under Marco Silva do not bear thinking about. David Hytner	1	-0.9917173385620117,-0.9994316697120667
916	Liverpool	Tottenham Hotspur	2	0	11/02/2017	17	Simon Mignolet is not the only Liverpool player uncertain to keep his place following the anaemic display at Hull City as Jürgen Klopp attempts to rectify an alarming run of results. His team have won once in 10, whereas Tottenham are unbeaten in 10 and will go seven points clear of Liverpool with a rare league win at Anfield. The hosts are, however, unbeaten in matches against their top six rivals this season and have not lost to Spurs since November 2012. Andy Hunter	1	-0.9946611523628235,0.9997042715549469
917	Manchester United	Watford	2	0	11/02/2017	17	Manchester United are unbeaten in 15 Premier League games yet they remain in sixth position, the place they have been stuck in since early November. The good news is United can start next week in fourth if Liverpool and Arsenal lose their matches on Saturday and United win, the bad news is United went down 3-1 to Watford in the reverse fixture in what was arguably the seasons’s poorest display. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.016727149486541748,0
918	Middlesbrough	Everton	0	0	11/02/2017	17	Middlesbrough have just returned from warm-weather training in Benidorm with Aitor Karanka hoping that the break will prove a watershed moment in their relegation fight. Although difficult to beat, Boro have won fewer Premier League games – four – than anyone, with their last victory coming in December. Karanka could probably do without meeting a recently somewhat more direct, higher tempo, Everton, who are very much the division’s form team. Much may hinge on the mood of his recently unsettled playmaker Gaston Ramírez. Louise Taylor	0	0.9034300297498703,-0.5271914005279541
919	Stoke City	Crystal Palace	1	0	11/02/2017	17	A 4-1 defeat at Selhurst Park in September was the low point of Stoke’s season; Palace travel to the Potteries after their own, more embarrassing, nadir at home to Sunderland and Mark Hughes believes that was the “worst outcome” for his side given the reaction Sam Allardyce will be demanding. Hughes himself would not mind a step up in performance after seeing his team go three games without a win. Nick Ames	1	-0.9891656637191772,0
920	Sunderland	Southampton	0	4	11/02/2017	17	While rivals head to the Gulf for warm-weather training next week, David Moyes is taking his players on a bonding break to sub-zero, snowy, New York. It seems illogical but as they proved by crushing Crystal Palace away last Saturday, Sunderland have a penchant for the unexpected. Indeed lack of consistency is their primary problem so the visit of a talented yet vulnerable Southampton represents a telling challenge. Can Moyes’s players win again or will they disappoint? Louise Taylor	-1	0.3393918077150981,-0.9640339612960815
921	West Ham United	West Brom	2	2	11/02/2017	17	West Bromwich travel to West Ham, a place below them in ninth, with the 40-point mark in sight and mid-table a blessing for two teams unlikely to climb much higher. Albion are undefeated in three while the Hammers again have fitness concerns over Andy Carroll, who has not trained all week and needs a goal to become the fifth man to score 30 Premier League goals for them. Mark Tallentire	0	0,0.20267057418823242
922	Burnley	Chelsea	1	1	12/02/2017	17	Antonio Conte is right to be wary of Burnley’s formidable home record – the third-best in the league – although Chelsea have a fine habit of switching on against supposed lesser opposition. Burnley are without three first-team midfielders, with Ashley Westwood and Robbie Brady in line to make their first starts. Sean Dyche’s side cannot absorb too many key absences but should have enough willpower to make Chelsea work hard for anything they take away. Nick Ames	0	0.2239449918270111,0
923	Swansea City	Leicester City	2	0	12/02/2017	17	Paul Clement has been named manager of the month for January and Claudio Ranieri has received the dreaded vote of confidence – in that context both men could be forgiven for feeling cursed before this pivotal meeting. It is a huge game for two clubs who are separated only by goal difference. Swansea have won three of their past five league matches. Leicester have lost their last four and have yet to score a league goal this year. Stuart James	1	0.9979300498962402,-0.9461235105991364
924	Bournemouth	Manchester City	0	2	13/02/2017	17	Manchester City arrive on the south coast in fine fettle after three consecutive wins, including fine attacking displays in their disposal of both Crystal Palace and West Ham United. Bournemouth are another team with a porous defence and one yet to record victory this calendar year. Everything is stacked against Eddie Howe, but his side have a habit of defying the odds, especially at home. Ben Fisher	-1	0.9195143183072408,0.9990906715393066
925	Chelsea	Swansea City	3	1	25/02/2017	17	Antonio Conte will consider this an opportunity to stretch Chelsea’s imposing lead at the top of the Premier League but Swansea are hugely improved and are now overseen by two former Blues. Claude Makelele will be afforded a huge ovation on his return as one of Paul Clement’s assistants. Carlo Ancelotti’s former No2 has won four of six league games and his side can sense a route to safety. “Now it’s about asking: ‘How much do we want to avoid suffering at the end of the season?’” said Clement. They are eager to secure the points required sooner rather than later, and even a trip to Chelsea will not daunt them. Dominic Fifield	1	-0.9934456944465637,0.0059652626514434814
926	Crystal Palace	Middlesbrough	1	0	25/02/2017	17	This may be Crystal Palace’s last chance to turn their season around. Middlesbrough, supremely stingy but without an away win since August, arrive at Selhurst Park hoping to emulate Sunderland’s recent saunter in south London by tapping into Palace’s insecurities at home. Palace, a team on edge even after a fortnight’s break, cannot afford another slip up. “It’s not Middlesbrough we’re playing against,” Sam Allardyce said. “We’re playing against ourselves.” This has to be their moment, or the Championship surely beckons. Dominic Fifield	1	-0.3436173001925151,0.9762423038482666
927	Everton	Sunderland	2	0	25/02/2017	17	David Moyes returns to Goodison Park for the first time since a 2-0 defeat in April 2014 marked the end of his reign at Manchester United. He can ill-afford another demoralising match against his former club. Sunderland are anchored to the bottom of the table and will need more than a trip to New York to recover from the 4-0 home defeat by Southampton. Leighton Baines is in line to make his 300th Premier League appearance for Everton. Andy Hunter	1	0.7696381509304047,-0.9984652101993561
928	Hull City	Burnley	1	1	25/02/2017	17	What might have been a relegation six-pointer at the beginning of the season is not because Burnley’s home form has been imperious. Their away form continues to be awful though, with just one point earned on their travels. Such travails will not be helped by an injury to Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Jeff Hendrick’s ban. Marco Silva’s resurgent side will be missing Sam Clucas through suspension but are otherwise likely to boast a side unchanged from the one that lost narrowly to Arsenal. Paul MacInnes	0	0.9814210534095764,-0.9982306957244873
929	Watford	West Ham United	1	1	25/02/2017	17	With 10 points separating Watford from the teams in the relegation zone and West Ham 12 points clear of trouble this could be described as a low-stakes game but Walter Mazzarri will know a 13th-placed finish cost his predecessor his job at Vicarage Road last summer. West Ham’s Andy Carroll looks set to miss out while he continues to recover from a groin injury but Aaron Cresswell returns. Paul MacInnes	0	-0.0004386007785797119,-0.920478343963623
930	West Brom	Bournemouth	2	1	25/02/2017	17	After three successive defeats Bournemouth are slipping towards danger and a visit to the Hawthorns is hardly the ideal place to spark a revival. The problem is abundantly clear, Eddie Howe’s side are too vulnerable in defence – conceding 21 goals in their past seven matches in all competitions. Tony Pulis will look to capitalise and if successful West Brom will be just nine points behind their record Premier League total. Graham Searles	1	0.9758357405662537,-0.9952773749828339
931	Tottenham Hotspur	Stoke City	4	0	26/02/2017	17	Tottenham will be keen to move on from their embarrassing Europa League exit at the hands of Gent on Thursday. The familiar surroundings of White Hart Lane should be a boost and it is hard to see Stoke troubling a home side looking to return to Europe’s elite competition next season. Mark Hughes, however, does have a wild card in Saido Berahino who is set to make his first Stoke start. Graham Searles	1	0.9798403382301331,0.005945056676864624
932	Leicester City	Liverpool	3	1	27/02/2017	17	It is a little over a year since an outrageous swing of Jamie Vardy’s right boot sent the ball sailing high over Simon Mignolet and it started to dawn that, just possibly, Leicester could actually win the Premier League title. Claudio Ranieri’s exit has given this match a new subplot but the central issue has not changed. The champions are in the bottom three and badly need a victory. Paul Chronnell	1	-0.3350437879562378,0
933	Leicester City	Hull City	3	1	04/03/2017	17	After that barnstorming victory over Liverpool on Monday night, when Jamie Vardy said the players were stung by the criticism they had received in the wake of Claudio Ranieri’s sacking, the challenge for Leicester is to reproduce something similar against Hull. Another win would surely lead to Craig Shakespeare being given the job until the end of the season. Hull, however, beat Leicester on the opening day and would move level on points with the champions if they can complete the double over them. Stuart James	1	-0.18831801414489746,0.9990981817245483
934	Liverpool	Arsenal	3	1	04/03/2017	17	Arsène Wenger, in his 50th and possibly last game managing Arsenal against Liverpool, will be looking for an important win in the race for Champions League qualification and to avoid Liverpool securing a league double over the Frenchman for the first time since 2000. Jürgen Klopp will be aware of some pressure growing regarding Liverpool’s slide this year and that may continue without Jordan Henderson. Klopp’s side with the England midfielder win 61.5% of matches and just 33.3% without. Graham Searles	1	0.018268167972564697,0.9988915324211121
935	Manchester United	Bournemouth	1	1	04/03/2017	17	This weekend is Manchester United’s chance to move up finally from the sixth place they have occupied since early November. As Liverpool play Arsenal on Saturday evening one side, at least, will drop points. This means that, should José Mourinho’s side defeat Bournemouth, they will definitely start the week in fifth whatever the result at Anfield. United last lost in the league at Chelsea in October so this will be a difficult ask for Eddie Howe. Jamie Jackson	0	0.0027607381343841553,0.9787140786647797
936	Stoke City	Middlesbrough	2	0	04/03/2017	17	“One important thing is that they’re in a comfortable position and we need three points,” said the Middlesbrough manager, Aitor Karanka, of this fixture, and while his assessment of Stoke is fair it is one that may grate in the Potteries. Last Sunday’s capitulation at Tottenham was not a good look and the frustration is that Stoke, while well-off in mid-table, never seem quite able to make that next step. The next few weeks will most likely see them shuttling between a nondescript set of places in the middle; should they be hoping for more, or is this their natural ceiling?

937	Swansea City	Burnley	3	2	04/03/2017	17	Paul Clement has transformed Swansea since taking over as manager but the next four games feel critical for the Welsh club, with Burnley’s visit followed by trips to Hull and Bournemouth and a home match against Middlesbrough. Swansea won at Burnley on the opening day, although that result was no indicator for what was to come for either club, with Sean Dyche’s side excellent at home ever since. Luciano Narsingh is pushing for a start for Swansea, while Jeff Hendrick returns from suspension for Burnley. Stuart James	1	-0.06736105680465698,0
938	Watford	Southampton	3	4	04/03/2017	17	Walter Mazzarri has called for a change in attitude from Watford, saying his side need to “stop sitting back” if they are to win more matches. However, it was no one but the Italian who replaced the injured forward Mauro Zárate with a midfielder at half-time in last week’s draw with West Ham. Zárate is out for the season with knee ligament damage and the Hornets will assess the fitness of Daryl Janmaat who also limped off against the Hammers. Saints will look to bounce back after losing the EFL Cup final when two Manolo Gabbiadini goals were not enough for Claude Puel. Paul MacInnes	-1	-0.2742368181546529,0.8046354055404663
939	West Brom	Crystal Palace	0	2	04/03/2017	17	Crystal Palace, who Tony Pulis is still in dispute with, will have the manager’s undivided attention and he will make sure West Brom are ready to extend Sam Allardyce’s stay in the relegation zone. However, the former England manager who, like Pulis, has never been relegated from the Premier League, is sure to be equally focused. Preparation may not be enough, though, as West Brom are enjoying their best-ever spell in the Premier League and will not want the party to end here.

940	Sunderland	Manchester City	0	2	05/03/2017	17	Between 2010 and 2013 Sunderland beat City 1-0 four times in succession on Wearside. That quartet of victories all came in league games but it is hard to imagine David Moyes’s side winning this one. Not that Fabio Borini is remotely deterred. “Manchester City seem a bit shaky at the back because of the way Pep Guardiola wants them to play,” says the Sunderland forward who believes his side can exploit this perceived fragility before celebrating a rare win.

941	Tottenham Hotspur	Everton	3	2	05/03/2017	17	Harry Kane versus Romelu Lukaku feels like the juiciest sub-plot; the strikers are leading the race for the Premier League’s Golden Boot this season, together with Arsenal’s Alexis Sánchez. But the bigger picture is the meeting between a Tottenham side that has come to look unbeatable at White Hart Lane and the division’s form side in Everton. Tottenham have won eight straight in the league on their own turf while nobody has a better record than Everton in 2017. Something has to give. David Hytner	1	0.48040273785591125,0
942	West Ham United	Chelsea	1	2	06/03/2017	17	West Ham have beaten Chelsea once this season, edging a tight EFL Cup tie on a fiery night at the London Stadium in October. Crowd trouble marred a fine win for Slaven Bilic’s side and it was a surprise to see this match moved to a late kick-off. West Ham, who will be hoping that Andy Carroll will be fit enough to replace the suspended Michail Antonio up front, will be desperate for the focus to remain on the pitch. Then again, Chelsea are likely to be out for revenge. Jacob Steinberg	-1	0.3312056064605713,-0.9738768339157104
943	Bournemouth	West Ham United	3	2	11/03/2017	17	Form-wise Bournemouth are in trouble. Winless in their past nine matches and conceding goals at a worrying rate. However, Eddie Howe’s side will be feeling good after working tirelessly to draw 1-1 at Old Trafford last time out. Equally, West Ham will be buoyed by Michail Antonio’s return. Slaven Bilic can count on Antonio and Andy Carroll terrorising Bournemouth’s shaky defence. Graham Searles	1	0.013723745942115784,0.9972309470176697
944	Everton	West Brom	3	0	11/03/2017	17	Everton’s nine-match unbeaten run was ended by Tottenham last week but Ronald Koeman still believes his side can snatch a top-six spot. If that is to materialise then Everton must win on Saturday. West Brom are chasing too, a record points total for the club in the Premier League. Tony Pulis’s miserly defence need to be at their best to keep on track and keep out a man they know all too well, Romelu Lukaku. Graham Searles	1	0.9942804872989655,0.0028056204319000244
945	Hull City	Swansea City	2	1	11/03/2017	17	With one of his leading scorers, Abel Hernández, unlikely to start and the other, Michael Dawson, an injured defender Marco Silva will have to look to the heroes of the 2-0 win at home to Liverpool, Alfred N’Diaye and Oumar Niasse. Swansea were relieved to win last week and their former Spain forward Fernando Llorente, in his best form of the season, is an aerial threat. Conrad Leach	1	0.995067834854126,0.9991925358772278
946	Liverpool	Burnley	2	1	12/03/2017	17	So, Liverpool beat Arsenal. Now comes a really difficult game, as some would have you believe, but if Jürgen Klopp’s team do not win this there will be some serious head scratching. Sean Dyche’s side will defend in numbers but have not won away this season in any competition. Their best result was October’s goalless draw at Old Trafford; a low was losing at Watford. Conrad Leach	1	0.0006679296493530273,-0.16827717423439026
947	Bournemouth	Swansea City	2	0	18/03/2017	17	Bournemouth are in danger of being drawn into a relegation scrap, while Swansea continue their own bid to escape the drop. Josh King’s hat-trick in a chaotic encounter with West Ham gave Eddie Howe’s side their first league win of 2017 last weekend following an eight-game barren streak. Swansea have lost their past three away matches, since winning at Anfield, and travel without key full-backs Kyle Naughton and Martin Olsson. Joel Rabinowitz	1	-0.8353326618671417,-0.9990222454071045
948	Crystal Palace	Watford	1	0	18/03/2017	17	It is five years to the day since Crystal Palace last beat Watford at Selhurst Park and, given the precarious nature of their position and the fact they face the top six in their remaining fixtures, Sam Allardyce’s side must surely emulate the class of 2012 if they are to survive this time round. Successive wins and clean sheets have given them heart but Patrick van Aanholt’s absence is a blow. Watford have won once away from home since mid-October but are within touching distance of safety and can tap into their hosts’ anxieties. Dominic Fifield	1	0.9987202882766724,0.9959275126457214
949	Everton	Hull City	4	0	18/03/2017	17	Amid Romelu Lukaku’s contract stand-off Everton will still be confident of earning a win that would temporarily move Ronald Koeman’s side above Manchester United in sixth place. Hull overcame Merseyside opponents with a 2-0 win over Liverpool in February and Marco Silva’s side will need a similarly robust display to take anything away from Goodison Park, where the hosts have lost just once all season in the league. Joel Rabinowitz	1	0.9995195865631104,-0.9152125716209412
950	Stoke City	Chelsea	1	2	18/03/2017	17	Despite the growing inevitability of the title returning to west London, Antonio Conte will not allow standards to slip as his Chelsea side aim to be crowned champions sooner rather than later. Conte will be wary of the challenge on Saturday having been pushed hard before winning 4-2 at Stamford Bridge on New Year’s Eve against a Stoke side unbeaten in their past eight home games. Joel Rabinowitz	-1	0,0.021130383014678955
951	Sunderland	Burnley	0	0	18/03/2017	17	David Moyes will hope Jermain Defoe celebrates his richly deserved England recall with a goal or two in what surely is a must-win game if Sunderland are to stay up. Burnley, though, are anxious to register a first away win and will sense opportunity at the home of their bottom-placed hosts. Moyes’s plan for Jan Kirchhoff to play a role has been dashed, the influential midfielder has been ruled out for another four weeks. Louise Taylor	0	-3.4570693969726562e-06,0.9888090789318085
952	West Brom	Arsenal	3	1	18/03/2017	17	Arsène Wenger will be hoping to improve on his head-to-head record of one win in seven away games against Tony Pulis when Arsenal visit The Hawthorns. The Frenchman’s side arrive after a bruising run of three defeats in their past four league matches and at risk of being cut adrift from the top four. West Bromwich, however, were complacent in defeat at Everton last week and will need to be much more focused to avoid another one. Joel Rabinowitz	1	-0.999545156955719,-0.9862696528434753
953	West Ham United	Leicester City	2	3	18/03/2017	17	Atlético Madrid can wait. Leicester City cannot afford to take their eye off the ball in the Premier League. Three points above the bottom three, they remain in a relegation fight despite reaching the Champions League quarter-finals thanks to Tuesday’s win over Sevilla. Craig Shakespeare will be confident of extending his winning start and West Ham United’s indifferent recent form means a fourth straight win for Leicester could be on the cards. Jacob Steinberg	-1	0,0.054834842681884766
954	Manchester City	Liverpool	1	1	19/03/2017	17	Manchester City have lost 1-0, 3-0, 4-1, and 2-1 in their past four Premier League games against Liverpool so have to reach back to August 2014 for their last win, 3-1 at the Etihad. Now is the time for Pep Guardiola’s side to end this sequence as, firstly, they have just suffered a Champions League elimination and, secondly, if City do win then the gap to Liverpool grows to four points with a match in hand. Jamie Jackson	0	-0.8604467213153839,0
955	Middlesbrough	Manchester United	1	3	19/03/2017	17	So there will be no warm reunion between the visiting José Mourinho and his former Real Madrid sidekick Aitor Karanka, after all, the Basque having parted company with Boro on Thursday. Instead Steve Agnew is auditioning for the job of keeping Boro in the top tier and could do with choreographing a first league win since mid-December. To that end he can only hope United are fatigued in the wake of their Thursday night Europa League exertions. Louise Taylor	-1	-0.3367617726325989,-0.9989560842514038
956	Tottenham Hotspur	Southampton	2	1	19/03/2017	17	For Tottenham, this is the start of another spell without Harry Kane. The last time he was unavailable, they won two out of five in the league, drawing the other three but it still felt as though he was badly missed. Would a similar run now be enough to keep them in pole position for a Champions League finish? Southampton’s top gun is fit and firing – Manolo Gabbiadini has six goals in four matches since his arrival from Napoli. David Hytner	1	-0.995515763759613,-0.006328791379928589
957	Burnley	Tottenham Hotspur	0	2	01/04/2017	17	Burnley have no reason to fear Tottenham given the way they have set about other top-six opponents at Turf Moor, and after six Premier League games without a win – their longest such run of the season – this would be the right time to bloody another nose. Relegation looks very unlikely and the fixture list is, after this, relatively kind. For the visitors it is a chance to steal a further march on at least one of Manchester City and Arsenal, who trail in their wake and play each other on Sunday. Nick Ames	-1	0.0032608509063720703,0
958	Arsenal	Manchester City	2	2	02/04/2017	17	Pep Guardiola admits Manchester City’s owners may be unhappy with the season even if the FA Cup is won. So imagine how discontented Arsenal fans will be with the embattled Arsène Wenger if he does not claim the trophy. The two league games between these sides ended in victory for City in December and a draw earlier this month. City are seven points ahead of Arsenal in the top flight having played one more match and they enter the tie as favourites. Yet it would be no great surprise if the erratic Gunners turn it on when required. Jamie Jackson	0	-0.996936559677124,0.33244534333546955
959	Bournemouth	Chelsea	1	3	08/04/2017	17	Bournemouth are unbeaten in five matches and their manager, Eddie Howe, says they are “feeling good and confident”. They will need all that confidence if they are to overcome Chelsea, who have lost away from home in the top flight only twice this season. Antonio Conte’s side may be given extra impetus if Tottenham cut the gap at the top the table to four points by beating Watford before this game kicks off. Rich Flower	-1	0.9998373985290527,-0.06418514251708984
960	Manchester City	Hull City	3	1	08/04/2017	17	Manchester City’s defeat at Chelsea forced Pep Guardiola to concede the title has “gone” but a Champions League place needs to be secured and these are three must-have points. Hull moved out of the bottom three for the first time since October with the win over Middlesbrough making it 17 points from 11 games since Marco Silva took over but must retrace their steps to 1930 for their last win at City. Mark Tallentire	1	0.8460041880607605,0.9657450318336487
961	Middlesbrough	Burnley	0	0	08/04/2017	17	The good news was that Middlesbrough managed to score a couple of goals at Hull on Wednesday, the bad that they conceded four. Steve Agnew conceded he “didn’t get the balance quite right” so it will be interesting to see whether Boro’s manager reverts to 4-2-3-1 or sticks with 4-4-2. One thing seems certain though; should the home side fail to beat a Burnleyteam still seeking their first away league victory of the season relegation will surely beckon. Louise Taylor	0	-0.9706932604312897,-0.9921870231628418
962	Stoke City	Liverpool	1	2	08/04/2017	17	Results suggest Stoke are in danger of falling back into their bad old ways of earlier in the season, when it took them eight games to record their first Premier League win. They have lost their last three although Mark Hughes has been at pains to suggest this is their most difficult run of the campaign. Relegation is the faintest of concerns but one more victory should banish any such thoughts and set their sights towards the top half once more. At least Liverpool, vulnerable after drawing with Bournemouth and losing Sadio Mané for the rest of the season, are not as daunting a prospect as they might have been. Nick Ames	-1	-0.994808554649353,-0.9943135976791382
963	Tottenham Hotspur	Watford	4	0	08/04/2017	17	There was mind games talk at Mauricio Pochettino’s press conference on Friday. What did he make of Antonio Conte’s suggestion that Chelsea had to win whereas it was more of a bonus for Tottenham? “Not interested,” he shot back. “If Chelsea don’t win the Premier League, it will be tough for them to accept,” he added. But Pochettino was interested only in his side keeping up the pressure, against a Watford team in the midst of an injury crisis. David Hytner	1	-0.918328732252121,-0.3273271918296814
964	West Brom	Southampton	0	1	08/04/2017	17	Albion are keen to match the eighth-place finish of 2013, their best since 1981, and though their Europa League hopes are fast fading they should give Tony Pulis his first top-10 finish. The visitors, one place behind them, have little to play for but remain a yardstick. “Southampton are a fantastic model … they are a top-10 team and they have some brilliant players,” Pulis said. Mark Tallentire	-1	0.9965013265609741,0.999833345413208
965	West Ham United	Swansea City	1	0	08/04/2017	17	If West Ham lose at home on Saturday Swansea will be only two points behind them and the fear of a humiliating relegation a few months after moving to the London Stadium could well force the club to dispense with the services of Slaven Bilic. But Swansea, who have been through a few managers themselves this season, seem to have come to the end of their revival under Paul Clement and have several injuries to contend with.

966	Everton	Leicester City	4	2	09/04/2017	17	A Champions League quarter-final at Atlético Madrid looms for the champions and rotation poses a dilemma for Craig Shakespeare after having picked a settled side during his flawless start in the job. Leicester’s prospects of a seventh successive victory in all competitions since the departure of Claudio Ranieri have been enhanced by an Everton defence depleted by injury and suspension. Matthew Pennington will replace the suspended Ashley Williams at centre-back with Ronald Koeman claiming: “If we win our next two home games we can challenge for fifth or sixth.” Andy Hunter	1	0.9836516976356506,0.3289400339126587
967	Sunderland	Manchester United	0	3	09/04/2017	17	Bottom placed Sunderland’s expensive February bonding trip to New York was supposed to save their season but in the six games since returning they have failed to score a single goal. David Moyes will aim to put this week’s controversy behind him by somehow masterminding a victory against his former club but, despite apparently prioritising the Europa League, José Mourinho presumably has very different ideas. Afterwards the pair can compare notes on being rude to broadcast interviewers. Louise Taylor	-1	-0.9979392290115356,0.7659165859222412
968	Crystal Palace	Arsenal	3	0	10/04/2017	17	Picture the scene. Gerry Francis drifts over a corner, Pat Jennings punches clear but only as far as Peter Nicholas just outside the box. The Welshman’s volley is scuffed, but Dave Swindlehurst’s flick takes the ball scuttling beyond static defenders and into the net. Terry Venables’ side withstand second-half pressure and the majority of a crowd of 42,699 departs elated. It is 10 November 1979 and Crystal Palace have achieved what remains their only home victory over Arsenal. Arsène Wenger could not have picked a better venue to seek to build on his team’s midweek win. Dominic Fifield	1	0.0023930370807647705,-0.9095363020896912
969	Crystal Palace	Leicester City	2	2	15/04/2017	17	A daunting run-in has actually coaxed the best out of Crystal Palace, with eye-catching victories over Chelsea and Arsenal already achieved this month. The challenge here is to maintain standards against the champions and to climb further from the condemned near the foot of the table. Leicester City will arrive in south London effectively safe and presumably with one eye on Tuesday’s return leg against Atlético Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals. The hosts will hope they are a team distracted. Dominic Fifield	0	0.0010387301445007324,0.9990963935852051
970	Everton	Burnley	3	1	15/04/2017	17	Sean Dyche is still searching for a first away win of the season to complement Burnley’s homegrown case for Premier League survival and it would constitute a minor shock should it arrive here on Saturday afternoon. Everton have won their past seven home matches while Romelu Lukaku has scored in eight consecutive Goodison games – a feat last achieved by Fred Pickering in 1965. Ross Barkley is available having suffered no serious injury when attacked in a bar last weekend and Ronald Koeman is expecting a cagey affair. “It will hard to create open chances against them,” the Everton manager said.

971	Southampton	Manchester City	0	3	15/04/2017	17	Claude Puel will be delighted if Manolo Gabbiadini returns – the Italian had scored nine times in his past eight games in all competitions for Napoli and Southampton before suffering a groin injury. It will be interesting to see if Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, nurtured by Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich and described by Puel as the “future” of Southampton, keeps his place against the side managed by his former mentor now that the club captain, Steven Davis, is approaching full fitness.

972	Stoke City	Hull City	3	1	15/04/2017	17	Jack Butland may make his long-awaited return for Stoke after over a year out with an ankle injury sustained on England duty. The goalkeeper is likely to be on the bench, particularly as Shay Given is a doubt with a minor back complaint. Hull, who have dragged themselves out of the bottom three with a remarkable revival under Marco Silva, have won away from home only once all season but will fancy their chances against a team who have lost their last four games.

973	Sunderland	West Ham United	2	2	15/04/2017	17	Sunderland supporters dare not contemplate just how much further adrift of safety their side would be had Slaven Bilic succeeded in taking Jermain Defoe to east London in January. Bilic, who could do with a win here as he endeavours to convince West Ham’s board that he remains the right man to lead them next season, may yet succeed in recruiting the England striker this summer, while Lamine Koné, David Moyes’s key centre-back, is another name on his shopping list.

974	Tottenham Hotspur	Bournemouth	4	0	15/04/2017	17	Mauricio Pochettino continues to look no further than the next game and at his own team. He says the prospect of Tottenham finishing above Arsenal is not on his mind and nor is ramping up the pressure on the leaders, Chelsea. Yet victory here would put both notions into sharper focus. Bournemouth could be forgiven a measure of trepidation – they have found a bit of form but Tottenham appear unbeatable at White Hart Lane. David Hytner	1	-0.1356269121170044,-0.0014587640762329102
975	Watford	Swansea City	1	0	15/04/2017	17	To say that Swansea need a win is an understatement. A horror run of one point from five games has put Paul Clement’s side back in the bottom three after an initial revival under their new manager. Watford, with a defence hampered by injury and suspension, lost 4-0 at Tottenham last week and look vulnerable but Swansea were abject at West Ham and need to shed their anxiety if they are to prosper.

976	Manchester United	Chelsea	2	0	16/04/2017	17	Whatever José Mourinho says publicly he will want to beat his former side, especially given the 4-0 humiliation in October’s reverse fixture. After he called out all five attackers fielded in Thursday’s 1-1 draw at Anderlecht, Sunday’s question is how they will respond against Chelsea. To hear Zlatan Ibrahimovic named in this group was a surprise as without his 28 goals how dismal might United’s season have been? Jamie Jackson	1	-0.9922670722007751,-0.9378372430801392
977	West Brom	Liverpool	0	1	16/04/2017	17	A Champions League place next season is very much in Liverpool’s hands, but after dropping points against Bournemouth and the scare last time out at Stoke nobody at Anfield is counting any chickens. That is probably a good mindset for a visit to The Hawthorns, where Tony Pulis’s side easily duffed up Arsenal last month and will be sure to test the Merseysiders’ defensive resolve.

978	Middlesbrough	Arsenal	1	2	17/04/2017	17	Arsène Wenger may think he has problems at Arsenal but Middlesbrough really are in trouble. The only side in English league football not to have registered a win during 2017, their last top-flight victory (against Swansea) was on 17 December. Wenger meanwhile acknowledges that a top-four finish represents “a massive challenge” for his stumbling team, conceding “we might do it, we might not”. The odds on both he and Boro’s Steve Agnew remaining in charge of these clubs come August appear pretty slender. Louise Taylor	-1	0.4936242252588272,-0.9780022501945496
979	Bournemouth	Middlesbrough	4	0	22/04/2017	17	Twenty years ago a Middlesbrough team containing Emerson, Juninho and Fabrizio Ravanelli somehow managed to get relegated and it appears, barring a miracle, Boro will be marking the anniversary with another top-flight demotion. If that miracle is to occur, it must start with a win on Saturday followed by another against Sunderland in midweek. Anything else will surely leave Steve Agnew’s side with too much to do given their nightmarish run-in. Rich Flower	1	0.9998767375946045,-0.9985602498054504
980	Hull City	Watford	2	0	22/04/2017	17	Marco Silva says his players can handle “big pressure” and a win here would give a huge boost to Hull’s hopes of avoiding relegation and transfer some of that pressure on to their survival rivals. Watford are not mathematically safe on 40 points and have some difficult fixtures to come before the end of the season but a 12-point cushion should be enough to ensure their safety.

981	Swansea City	Stoke City	2	0	22/04/2017	17	While Stoke require more consistency if ninth place is to be theirs this season the real pressure is on Swansea, for whom the winter revival under Paul Clement is starting to look very distant after five defeats in six matches. The games are starting to run out. Clement will have earmarked this one as a good bet for three points and a wildly unpredictable Stoke, for whom Jack Butland could make a long-awaited return from injury, could just as easily oblige as hammer another nail in their coffin.

982	West Ham United	Everton	0	0	22/04/2017	17	Although they are nine points above the bottom three, West Ham cannot relax yet. Slaven Bilic’s options have been limited by Andy Carroll’s groin injury and suspensions to Sam Byram and Mark Noble, while another concern for the manager must be Romelu Lukaku’s record against his side.

983	Burnley	Manchester United	0	2	23/04/2017	17	José Mourinho is unlikely to take this one lightly even though the effects of playing 120 minutes against Anderlecht on Thursday and significant injuries to Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marcos Rojo suggest they may struggle. United’s manager is so short of options the club’s captain and record scorer, Wayne Rooney, overlooked as substitute against the Belgian club, may even be pressed into service.

There is no prospect of a repeat, at least in terms of early departures and managerial isolation, with Liverpool in pursuit of Champions League qualification. Joe Gomez could make his first Premier League appearance of the season with Joel Matip, Ragnar Klavan and Lucas Leiva struggling, although Mamadou Sakho’s ineligibility against his parent club represents a greater loss to Palace.

Yet one more win should ease the lingering nerves at both clubs, and the visitors will hope to exploit Crystal Palace’s crippling injury list at centre-back.

986	Southampton	Hull City	0	0	29/04/2017	17	Hull City need an away win having lost six and drawn one of Marco Silva’s seven league trips and can call on Oumar Niasse, who had his red card rescinded for last week’s sending off, as they battle for safety with Swansea, who are at Manchester United on Sunday. Saints are on 40 points, have lost their last two but have yet to knock off if their efforts in the 4-2 defeat at Chelsea are to be believed. Mark Tallentire	0	0.7601301670074463,0.9850608706474304
987	Stoke City	West Ham United	0	0	29/04/2017	17	Five defeats in the past six games have put Stoke’s chances of finishing in the top 10 for a fourth successive season in serious jeopardy and West Ham United will move above them in the table with a win. This could bode ill for Mark Hughes, especially after the Stoke manager spoke of “raised expectations” among fans. The visitors will miss the physical presence of Andy Carroll in attack and will be hoping their record signing, André Ayew, can fill the void. Rich Flower	0	0.33352214097976685,-0.9993017911911011

West Brom have lost their way a little, losing the last three and failing to score in four successive league matches – five would be a club record.

Everton may be mediocre on the road but they revel in the comforts of home, winning their last eight, with Romelu Lukaku scoring 14 goals in his last nine Goodison appearances. Tottenham will crave a ninth straight win for Ronald Koeman’s team ahead of the north London derby but another wild Conte celebration would be more than justified should Chelsea prevail.

991	Manchester United	Swansea City	1	1	30/04/2017	17	Manchester United’s exhausting season continues against Swansea City, who they defeated 3-1 in November. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (two) and Paul Pogba scored United’s goals but both are injured now. Given that eight players are unavailable, including the suspended Marouane Fellaini, José Mourinho is down to the bare bones before Thursday’s Europa League semi-final trip to Celta Vigo. Swansea are third-bottom and fighting for their lives so this may be a cagey encounter. Jamie Jackson	0	-0.949549655119578,-0.9932049512863159
992	Middlesbrough	Manchester City	2	2	30/04/2017	17	Middlesbrough may have enjoyed pushing fellow strugglers – and north-east rivals – Sunderland to the brink of relegation with a 1-0 win in midweek but the three points have come too late to make much difference for Steve Agnew’s side. Boro remain six points from safety and after facing Manchester City they still have games against Chelsea and Liverpool. The chances of a miraculous survival look slim. Rich Flower	0	-0.33418192466100055,0
993	Tottenham Hotspur	Arsenal	2	0	30/04/2017	17	Mauricio Pochettino said he had not heard of “St Totteringham’s Day” – the annual bit of gloating from Arsenal fans about their team’s supremacy over Tottenham. But the Spurs manager is surely about to dismantle it. Win the derby and Spurs will finish above their neighbours for the first time in 22 years. Pochettino wants more. His sights are set on “finishing above all 19 clubs”. He clings to the belief his team could yet reel in Chelsea. David Hytner	1	-0.42114296555519104,-0.9586326479911804
994	Bournemouth	Stoke City	2	2	06/05/2017	17	Tenth hosts 12th with manager Eddie Howe still preaching the importance of mathematically ensuring Bournemouth’s Premier League status. They are nine points clear of relegation, with three games remaining but a much bigger prize looms, a top-half finish. In-form Joshua King, who has scored 12 goals in his last 14 appearances, will again look to showcase his talents against a Stoke team who have not won on the road since January.

995	Burnley	West Brom	2	2	06/05/2017	17	A first away win of the season at Crystal Palace brought Burnley to the verge of guaranteed survival and in truth it would take quite a turn of events for them to be endangered now. One more point would take them to the vaunted 40 mark and they should fancy their chances of gaining at least that against a West Brom side that, with four consecutive defeats and five games without a goal, has tailed off dramatically. Six places and five points separate the sides but it is not entirely fanciful to imagine Burnley making that ground up over the final few games. Nick Ames	0	-0.16542521119117737,-0.8039025068283081
996	Hull City	Sunderland	0	2	06/05/2017	17	Sunderland may be down but they will also play a big part in who goes with them as they follow this with a visit from Swansea, who would be five points adrift at 5pm if Hull record their seventh win from Marco Silva’s eight home games. David Moyes has intimated he is staying at Sunderland and knows what has to be done to get them back up, which suggests a mass clear-out. Mark Tallentire	-1	0.9981581568717957,0.7763005495071411
997	Leicester City	Watford	3	0	06/05/2017	17	With 40 points apiece on the board, there is little to choose between these two clubs in the league table, yet everything points to a win for the outgoing Premier League champions. With Jamie Vardy scoring freely, Leicester are marching on under Craig Shakespeare and targeting a top-10 finish. Watford have similar ambitions but have lost their past four away matches without scoring and may start to get a little twitchy if they are not mathematically safe after this weekend.

998	Manchester City	Crystal Palace	5	0	06/05/2017	17	As the final four games of Pep Guardiola’s first Premier League campaign are embarked upon Manchester City were not supposed to be merely fighting for a Champions League berth. But this is the unwanted scenario and, with Sam Allardyce’s Crystal Palace still not quite safe from relegation, this may prove a tricky contest for the home side, who are without Sergio Agüero. Jamie Jackson	1	0.9819412231445312,-0.9748418927192688
999	Swansea City	Everton	1	0	06/05/2017	17	A huge game for Swansea, who could be five points behind Hull by the time they kick off at 5.30pm. Either way, Everton’s visit seems like must-win territory for Paul Clement’s side, who have regained some confidence by beating Stoke and then drawing at Old Trafford last Sunday. Everton, on the face of it, have little to play for and their away record – winless in their past six matches – is nothing to write home about. Swansea, though, have never beaten Everton at home.

1000	Arsenal	Manchester United	2	0	07/05/2017	17	It is the statistic that needles Arsène Wenger. In 15 competitive matches, the Arsenal managerArsène Wenger is still to defeat José Mourinho. Wenger has talked about being open to a truce with his long-time adversary but what he really wants is a victory over him. If it happened, the top-four picture would look a lot brighter for Arsenal. Anything less and it could be over. Manchester United’s Europa League semi-final with Celta Vigo may colour the selection of their side. David Hytner	1	6.16908073425293e-05,0.9875582158565521
1001	Liverpool	Southampton	0	0	07/05/2017	17	Jürgen Klopp denies Liverpool struggle at Anfield – saying it was just “the moments” that let Bournemouth and Crystal Palace to take points from the last two home games – but they do have a problem with Southampton. This will be the seventh meeting between the sides in the past two seasons. Liverpool have won only once so far, a 6-1 rout in the Capital One Cup, and have not scored in three games against Claude Puel’s team this term. Philippe Coutinho is on course to recover from the dead leg suffered at Watford on Monday, with the home needing to hold their nerve in the race for Champions League qualification. Andy Hunter	0	-0.09447166323661804,0
1002	Chelsea	Middlesbrough	3	0	08/05/2017	17	Middlesbrough tested Chelsea severely at the Riverside stadium late in November but go into this match acutely aware that their Premier League status could be surrendered if they do not conjure an improbable win on Monday. There will be no let up from the league leaders with the finishing line in sight, though Antonio Conte will be wary of the potential absence of David Luiz and N’Golo Kanté after knocks. “There will be two teams desperate for a result on Monday,” said the Italian. “For this reason, we will see a really good game on Monday.” Dominic Fifield	1	0.986522376537323,0.3702312111854553
1003	Bournemouth	Burnley	2	1	13/05/2017	17	Both sides were tipped for relegation but Bournemouth can secure their highest ever finish in the club’s 118-year history with a point against Burnley and Sean Dyche’s side have already guaranteed their best finish since 1975. However, Eddie Howe will surely be looking for three points to aid their bid for a top-half finish and with the prolific Joshua King starting they have a great chance. Graham Searles	1	0.9994281232357025,0
1004	Manchester City	Leicester City	2	1	13/05/2017	17	Manchester City lost December’s reverse fixture 4-2 and six months later the jury remains out on Pep Guardiola as they continue to fight for a Champions League berth. The Catalan believes Leicester will again try and counter-attack but he will also have known that in the pre-Christmas game. It did not allow his men to stymie Leicester then, so the hope will be that Vincent Kompany’s recent return can make a difference as he was missing for that last meeting. Jamie Jackson	1	0.9845072031021118,-0.29127824306488037
1005	Middlesbrough	Southampton	1	2	13/05/2017	17	With Middlesbrough down and Southampton mid-table it all looks slightly meaningless but the two managers, at least, have much to play for. While Claude Puel, puzzlingly “under pressure” on the south coast intends to convince his board to keep him on next season, Steve Agnew, Boro’s interim boss is hoping against hope that, come August, he might still be in charge in the Championship. Was it really only a year ago that Aitor Karanka’s Boro were celebrating promotion here? Louise Taylor	-1	-0.9944681227207184,0
1006	Stoke City	Arsenal	1	4	13/05/2017	17	Arsenal have not won at Stoke for seven years and ordinarily this might look the least appetising of away fixtures as they continue their late revival in the Champions League shake-up. But the Potters have won only once in their last nine games and a bottom-half finish looks increasingly likely. That will only count as regression when Mark Hughes’s performance is assessed at the season’s end but they can at least show that some things remain the same with a rousing performance against opponents that tend to bring the bet365 Stadium to life.	-1	0,0
1007	Sunderland	Swansea City	0	2	13/05/2017	17	A day of farewells for Sunderland – Jermain Defoe and Jordan Pickford surely making their final appearances at the Stadium of Light and season ticket holders saying goodbye to the Premier League – offers Swansea a chance to take a significant step towards safety. Already relegated, David Moyes’s side have not won a game here since mid-December but they sprung a surprise by beating Hull last Saturday. Could Paul Clement’s side be in for a similarly nasty shock? Louise Taylor	-1	0.9982803165912628,-0.9941065311431885
1008	Crystal Palace	Hull City	4	0	14/05/2017	17	There is a vague possibility Crystal Palace could effectively be safe come kick-off on Sunday lunchtime but, more probably, they will remain on edge and this will be an excruciatingly tense occasion. Hull’s predicament – chasing Swansea with a notably inferior goal difference to boot – means they simply have to win. Their away record is the worst in the division, but Palace are the most obliging at home with 11 defeats to date. A 12th would thrust them to the brink of the Championship given a final day trip to Old Trafford. Nerves will be frayed. Dominic Fifield	1	-0.9840161800384521,-0.9966662526130676
1009	Tottenham Hotspur	Manchester United	2	1	14/05/2017	17	After 118 years, Tottenham are to bring down the curtain on White Hart Lane and nostalgia will be in the air, particularly with the club having planned a grand post-match ceremony. Mauricio Pochettino wants to give the old place the send-off it deserves, with what would be a 17th consecutive win in all competitions. Tottenham are unbeaten at the Lane this season and José Mourinho has made it plain that Manchester United’s priority is the Europa League. David Hytner	1	0.8576967716217041,0
1010	West Ham United	Liverpool	0	4	14/05/2017	17	Liverpool have toiled at Anfield recently, but their away form offers encouragement before a tricky London Stadium test. With the top-four race increasingly hard to read, a fourth successive away win would calm Liverpool’s nerves. West Ham, however, are poised to trip them up after last week’s win over Tottenham. Slaven Bilic is yet to lose to Jürgen Klopp in four meetings. Jacob Steinberg	-1	0.9963609576225281,0.9773771166801453
1011	Arsenal	Everton	3	1	21/05/2017	17	The sweet relief of knowing whether Arsène Wenger intends to remain the manager of Arsenal is close. But before the hyperbole ends Arsenal will attempt to complete their mistimed excellent run of form against Everton. They have a chance of qualifying for the Champions League but only if Liverpool or Manchester City slip up. If not, Arsenal will join Everton in the Europa League. Graham Searles	1	0.9036994576454163,0
1012	Burnley	West Ham United	1	2	21/05/2017	17	Tony Pulis recently described Sean Dyche as “one of the league’s top three managers” and his achievement in securing Burnley’s first consecutive season of top-flight football since the 1970s is certainly an impressive one. West Ham have had a disappointing season and Slaven Bilic will be well aware defeat on the final day will do nothing for his long-term future at the club. Both sides would receive additional financial rewards if they were to win and leapfrog those above them. Freddie Paxton	-1	0.8481672406196594,-0.9992249011993408
1013	Chelsea	Sunderland	5	1	21/05/2017	17	Top meets bottom on Sunday and, while the end of this season will feel like a mercy for Sunderland, Chelsea will consider their post-match celebrations the start of something potentially special. Gary Cahill and the departing John Terry will lift the Premier League trophy after the game with the FA Cup final and further squad strengthening to come this summer. Antonio Conte and the club are determined to capitalise on this success. The future is starker for David Moyes and those from Wearside but their own close season of re-structuring awaits.

1014	Hull City	Tottenham Hotspur	1	7	21/05/2017	17	Tottenham travel to relegated Hull City with Harry Kane eager to secure the Golden Boot for a second successive season. The England international is in pole position after his four goals at Leicester took him to 26 in the league, two clear of Romelu Lukaku. For Hull, if nothing else, some of the players will be looking to put themselves in the shop window before the transfer window opens. Freddie Paxton	-1	-0.9985349178314209,0.9973702132701874
1015	Leicester City	Bournemouth	1	1	21/05/2017	17	Leicester host Bournemouth in a match that will decide which club finishes in the top half. Craig Shakespeare’s side have salvaged their season but could be waving goodbye to Riyad Mahrez and Kasper Schmeichel come full time at the King Power Stadium. Bournemouth have done remarkably well this term and finishing above last season’s champions Leicester would be a triumph. Freddie Paxton	0	0.9899124205112457,0.8481166362762451
1016	Liverpool	Middlesbrough	3	0	21/05/2017	17	The task is simple for Jürgen Klopp’s side: beat an already relegated opponent on home soil, one that has not won a league game at Anfield since 1976 and has won only once on the road this season, and qualification for the Champions League will be confirmed. So why is there anxiety around Liverpool before Middlesbrough’s visit? That is simple too. Liverpool have not won at home since losing Sadio Mané to injury in the Merseyside derby in April and have often struggled against the lesser lights this season, although they won comfortably at the Riverside in December. Andy Hunter	1	-0.3118300239245097,0.9976814985275269
1017	Manchester United	Crystal Palace	2	0	21/05/2017	17	José Mourinho’s complaint about Manchester United’s number of games has been aired yet again, the manager saying they have played “37 games” since January. Crystal Palace will hardly care and in a meaningless match Mourinho will pray Paul Pogba, who has to play owing to rustiness, does not go down injured before Wednesday night’s Europa League final against Ajax in Stockholm.

1018	Southampton	Stoke City	0	1	21/05/2017	17	Stoke have long since had little to play for and have won only one of their past 10 games, having seemingly switched off. Southampton’s form has also been underwhelming with one win in seven and Claude Puel faces questions over his future. Both sides have a point to prove and will be eager to give their fans something to cheer. Southampton will be without Shane Long who has a broken metatarsal.

1019	Swansea City	West Brom	2	1	21/05/2017	17	Swansea are on a high after securing top-flight survival last week and Paul Clement will want to end the campaign with a win in front of their own supporters as well as climbing as high in the table as possible – every place is worth around £2m in extra prize money. Tony Pulis will be hoping to arrest an alarming slump that has seen West Brom fail to record a victory since 18 March. Rich Flower	1	0.999483585357666,0.0016651451587677002
1020	Watford	Manchester City	0	5	21/05/2017	17	Manchester City need a point against Watford to ensure Champions League football next season and it would be a disaster if events somehow conspired against Pep Guardiola’s side. Recent results have been awful for Watford with the club on for their longest losing streak in 44 years if they fall to City. Walter Mazzarri’s farewell could be brief after never really ingratiating himself with fans. Graham Searles	-1	-0.3273695707321167,-0.9993119239807129
1021	Arsenal	Leicester City	4	3	11/08/2017	18	There remain a number of question marks around Arsenal’s makeup for the new season. Have they seen the last of Alexis Sánchez? When will they be able to field their first-choice defence? But it still appears to be a more stable environment than the one in which they began last season. They lost, crucially as it turned out, to Liverpool on the opening day; Arsène Wenger knows a fast start is important this time around to make the idea of a new beginning more sellable and he will be buoyed by aspects of the Community Shield performance against Chelsea. His team look especially lively down the flanks: can they conjure up a nerve-settling early goal for their big signing, Alexandre Lacazette, or will Leicester’s own new boy Kelechi Iheanacho steal the show? Nick Ames	1	0.4977405220270157,0
1022	Brighton	Manchester City	0	2	12/08/2017	18	Brighton make their long-awaited Premier League debut knowing that, while a match against Manchester City may be considered a free hit, home form will be crucial to their survival. A previously slow summer of transfer activity stepped up this week with the arrivals of Davy Pröpper from Ajax and, imminently, the Club Brugge winger José Izquierdo but City have left most others in the dust when it comes to expenditure during this window and Pep Guardiola will want his own side to set down a marker early on.

1023	Chelsea	Burnley	2	3	12/08/2017	18	Victor Moses’s red card in the FA Cup final means he is suspended for Chelsea’s first league game of the season. César Azpilicueta will switch to the right with the new signing Antonio Rüdiger coming in to the back three. Álvaro Morata, another new recruit, will lead the line now Diego Costa is out of favour. Burnley will miss Michael Keane in defence while Jon Walters will have a tough task replacing Andre Gray up front. Rich Flower	-1	-0.3271886905034383,-0.9844099283218384
1024	Everton	Stoke City	1	0	12/08/2017	18	There could be 10 new signings on display across both teams on the opening day of the season at Goodison Park yet Ronald Koeman and Mark Hughes would prefer more as their respective pursuits of Gylfi Sigurdsson and Bruno Martins Indi drag on. The rebuilding of Everton and Stoke may be incomplete but both managers have the immediate task of getting a new-look team to gel. Next up for Koeman are Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United so a good start is imperative. Andy Hunter	1	0.40329718589782715,0.9976814985275269
1025	Southampton	Swansea City	0	0	12/08/2017	18	This will be Mauricio Pellegrino’s first match in charge at St Mary’s but the 90 or so minutes will inevitably be overshadowed by missing parties. Neither the Southampton captain, Virgil van Dijk, or Swansea City’s playmaker, Gylfi Sigurdsson, will feature with question marks over their futures. Saints’ record signing, Mario Lemina, could make his debut after joining from Juventus on Tuesday and Pellegrino’s other summer signing, Jan Bednarek, could also feature. The 19-year-old striker Tammy Abraham is expected to lead the line on his full Swansea debut. Ben Fisher	0	-0.33400436242421466,0.9978817105293274
1026	Watford	Liverpool	3	3	12/08/2017	18	Philippe Coutinho may be the main conversation topic but he will not be on the pitch – the Brazilian is out with a back problem. Liverpool are also without Adam Lallana and Daniel Sturridgedue to injury. They travel to Vicarage Road uncertain of what kind of opponents they will face in Watford, now managed by Marco Silva and with seven new signings jostling for places. One of those, record transfer Andre Gray, looks certain to start up front in the absence of the injured Troy Deeney while Nathaniel Chalobah is likely to anchor midfield after permanently returning to the club where he played on loan five seasons ago.

1027	West Brom	Bournemouth	1	0	12/08/2017	18	One point and one place separated these teams last season but Bournemouth only stole into ninth position following West Brom’s traditional slide into summer once safety had been assured. Tony Pulis’s side took only two points from their last nine games and have not won since mid-March. Do not bet against Pulis, the arch-pragmatist, rectifying that in this match against Eddie Howe’s improving but still unpredictable side. Paul Chronnell	1	-0.9709942936897278,-0.9822486639022827
1028	Manchester United	West Ham United	4	0	13/08/2017	18	Manchester United lost only once at home last season but 15 draws meant they finished sixth. One of the draws was November’s 1-1 with West Ham so what José Mourinho does not want is a repeat. Losing to Slaven Bilic’s side would be unthinkable but having spent £75m on Romelu Lukaku, £31m on Victor Lindelof and around £40m on Nemanja Matic this should not occur.

1029	Newcastle United	Tottenham Hotspur	0	2	13/08/2017	18	The joy of Newcastle United’s return to the Premier League with Rafael Benítez appears tarnished by Mike Ashley’s puzzling parsimony while Tottenham’s Mauricio Pochettino has transfer market problems of his own. No matter; this remains an enticing, and intriguing, fixture, particularly as Spurs will presumably want revenge for their 5-1 thrashing here in May 2016. Given the chasm in quality between the two squads few are respecting a repeat of that scoreline; indeed Benítez would probably be happy with a point in front of another full house. Louise Taylor	-1	0.8487018942832947,0.9996786117553711
1030	Bournemouth	Watford	0	2	19/08/2017	18	Eddie Howe will be looking for a reaction from his side after an underwhelming performance in the 1-0 defeat by West Brom last weekend. Jermain Defoe could make his first start for Bournemouth since May 2001 and Jordon Ibe may return to the starting lineup. “We need to get our momentum going and get our tempo going and if we can do that then hopefully we will get a result,” Howe said. Watford, who drew 3-3 with Liverpool in their entertaining season opener, should have their captain, Troy Deeney, available following groin surgery.

1031	Burnley	West Brom	0	1	19/08/2017	18	Burnley have never made a better start to a Premier League campaign, or perhaps any campaign. It took them 18 games to win away last season and now they have recorded one at the first attempt, at the home of the champions, no less. Expectations will be high at Turf Moor but Tony Pulis’s side are unlikely to fall apart like Chelsea. The two sides appear evenly matched, and while Albion’s away form is not great either, it would not be an enormous surprise to see the points shared, as happened last season when Burnley came back down to earth after their win at Crystal Palace.

1032	Leicester City	Brighton	2	0	19/08/2017	18	After opening the season with defeats, both clubs will be keen to get points on the board. Leicester let victory slip through their fingers against Arsenal while Brighton could only hold out for so long against Manchester City. Keeping Jamie Vardy quiet will be the main task for Brighton after the England international scored twice in a superb individual performance at Arsenal. Kelechi Iheanacho, who was signed from Manchester City to play alongside Vardy, remains troubled by a toe complaint. Izzy Brown, who has a hamstring problem, is out for Brighton. Stuart James	1	-0.9784073829650879,0.80368572473526
1033	Liverpool	Crystal Palace	1	0	19/08/2017	18	Crystal Palace can become only the fourth visiting team in history to win four successive league games at Anfield but it will take a major transformation from the opening day to achieve that feat. A 3-0 home defeat by newly promoted Huddersfield Town represented a galling start for new manager, Frank de Boer, who also lost Wilfried Zaha to injury, while Liverpool will be looking to build on a valuable Champions League play-off win at Hoffenheim on Tuesday. That exhausting first leg may prompt changes by Jürgen Klopp before next week’s return, though his options appear limited. Andy Hunter	1	-0.9969124794006348,0.9981873035430908
1034	Southampton	West Ham United	3	2	19/08/2017	18	Mauricio Pellegrino has few injury concerns for a fixture that has been switched to St Mary’s with the London Stadium not ready after the world championships. Ryan Bertrand has recovered from a knock, while Cédric Soares should start despite reported interest from Chelsea. Southampton are under new ownership and insist that Virgil van Dijk will stay, although the Dutchman remains unavailable for this game. For West Ham, Michail Antonio is fit again after four months out with a hamstring injury. Slaven Bilic will be targeting defensive improvement against a team without a home goal in six league games.

1035	Stoke City	Arsenal	1	0	19/08/2017	18	Stoke City’s recruitment of Jesé Rodríguez on a season-long loan from Paris Saint-Germain means Mark Hughes now has five Champions League winners in his squad, more than any other Premier League club. The winger is expected to be involved at some stage against Arsenal, 4-1 winners here in May and eager to secure a return to Europe’s elite club competition after finishing fifth last season.

1036	Swansea City	Manchester United	0	4	19/08/2017	18	Everything fell into place for Manchester United against West Ham last Sunday and it will be a surprise if José Mourinho’s team fail to pick up another three points . Mourinho’s only real selection dilemma revolves around whether he should set up a bit more conservatively away from home and recall Ander Herrera. As for Swansea, they are still without Fernando Llorente, who is building up his fitness after breaking an arm. Roque Mesa could make his debut in place of Leon Britton, who is struggling with a back problem. Stuart James	-1	-0.027909040451049805,-0.9836458265781403
1037	Tottenham Hotspur	Chelsea	1	2	20/08/2017	18	Antonio Conte will be been forced to make changes after last week’s disastrous 3-2 home defeat by Burnley – Gary Cahill and Cesc Fàbregas are both suspended after being sent off. Victor Moses is back following a ban but the Chelsea manager will also be hoping Pedro and summer signing Tiémoué Bakayoko come through fitness tests otherwise his squad, with 26 players out on loan, will be stretched to the limit.

1038	Manchester City	Everton	1	1	21/08/2017	18	After the convincing 2-0 win at Brighton in the campaign opener, Manchester City face a sterner test in Everton. Pep Guardiola’s default system may now be a back three which is why the West Brom central defender Jonny Evans is being pursued. The last time City faced Ronald Koeman’s side they suffered a 4-0 defeat at Goodison Park. The corresponding home league game was a 1-1 draw City dominated, so the manager will hope that match, not January’s reverse, is an augury of Monday’s meeting.

1039	Bournemouth	Manchester City	1	2	26/08/2017	18	Manchester City have beaten Bournemouth 15-1 on aggregate across their past four meetings, so a visit to the south coast seems the perfect match to remedy the wrongs of Monday night – when they rescued a draw against Everton. Bournemouth are point-less and yet to score in the league, although a midweek EFL Cup win at Birmingham has given Eddie Howe a welcome selection problem. “The positive thing from the week is that several players played well,” the Bournemouth manager said. “I’ll have to think hard about the team I pick.” Ben Fisher	-1	0.03430354595184326,0.9941727519035339
1040	Crystal Palace	Swansea City	0	2	26/08/2017	18	Selhurst Park was the venue for Paul Clement’s first game in charge of Swansea back in January, the recently appointed manager leaving his seat in the stand at half-time to address his players and help inspire a late victory in a relegation scrap. The mood around both clubs suggests another awaits them. Neither has scored a league goal yet. Palace and their new manager, Frank de Boer, will be without Ruben Loftus-Cheek, his best player to date, and must find a way of coaxing some form from Christian Benteke if they are to kickstart their campaign.

1041	Manchester United	Leicester City	2	0	26/08/2017	18	Manchester United host Leicester City after recording consecutive 4-0 wins but despite that José Mourinho has warned his players that Leicester are back to their title-winning best. But the United juggernaut will take some stopping at Old Trafford, especially as they will be intent on signing off before the international break with momentum maintained.

1042	Newcastle United	West Ham United	3	0	26/08/2017	18	After two league defeats Newcastle could do with a win but will be wary of the aerial threat posed by West Ham’s Andy Carroll on the former local hero’s latest return to Tyneside. If Rafael Benítez has problems, so does his opposite number. Slaven Bilic is well aware of the persistent rumours suggesting West Ham would not be averse to replacing him with a Newcastle counterpart openly unhappy with Mike Ashley’s transfer market parsimony. Louise Taylor	1	-0.8578793704509735,0
1043	Watford	Brighton	0	0	26/08/2017	18	Watford are short of a defender after José Holebas’s red card in the Carabao Cup but Marco Silva will be relieved to suffer the suspension against Brighton. Chris Hughton’s side have yet to score in the league and struggled to beat Barnet on Tuesday. Silva, having already looked to have worked his magic with Watford, will be disappointed by anything other than three points. Graham Searles	0	-0.9881522357463837,-0.9987296462059021
1044	Chelsea	Everton	2	0	27/08/2017	18	Chelsea produced their most scintillating performance of last season in this fixture, tearing Everton to shreds to the tune of five goals. Yet that was a win inspired by Eden Hazard, a player now feeling his way back after an ankle operation, and the visitors are much changed these days. A sterner test awaits this time with the visitors steeled and the champions still to be properly strengthened before the transfer deadline. It would not take a lot to bring a summer of frustration back to the surface. Dominic Fifield	1	0.9547076423962911,0
1045	Liverpool	Arsenal	4	0	27/08/2017	18	Alexis Sánchez is set for his first appearance of the season and Laurent Koscielny is also available after suspension. Arsenal, on the evidence of their defeat at Stoke City plus Liverpool’s attacking display against Hoffenheim, need both back immediately. Jürgen Klopp’s side recorded a league double over them last season, scoring seven times. The form of Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané even without the service of Philippe Coutinho looks ominous for a visiting defence who, for all the talk at the end of last season, have changed little.

1046	Tottenham Hotspur	Burnley	1	1	27/08/2017	18	Burnley enjoyed themselves on their trip to London on the opening weekend when they stunned nine-man Chelsea and they intend to further Tottenham’s Wembley woes. Mauricio Pochettino has urged his players to look at the overall performance in the 2-1 defeat to Chelsea rather than the scoreline. He maintains it was good, featuring enough creativity and merely lacking cutting edge. Victory feels essential this time. David Hytner	0	-0.9915522336959839,0.9992482960224152
1047	West Brom	Stoke City	1	1	27/08/2017	18	West Brom seem in a hurry to amass their points tally to avoid relegation this season or maybe Tony Pulis has something much grander in mind. Regardless Pulis’s new signings have hit the ground running and, with the addition of Oliver Burke from RB Leipzig, Stoke could be fearing defeat at the Hawthorns. Mark Hughes will hope the shine from his side beating Arsenal has not worn off just yet. Graham Searles	0	-0.9891168475151062,0.9978849291801453
1048	Arsenal	Bournemouth	3	0	09/09/2017	18	Arsène Wenger says “every defeat is a crisis” and it certainly feels that way for him, as he chugs his way towards a 21st anniversary at Arsenal. The outpouring after the 4-0 humiliation at Liverpool last time out was visceral and everybody knows it will be replicated if they were to lose against Bournemouth – a club that is so far without a point, despite some encouraging performances. For the sake of humanity, Arsenal surely have to win. David Hytner	1	-0.037230104207992554,0.0461195707321167
1049	Brighton	West Brom	3	1	09/09/2017	18	Brighton are looking for their first win and league goal. There was some encouragement from their performance at Watford before the international break, with Anthony Knockaert making his first start. The worry for Chris Hughton will be that he was not able to sign a forward, which would have added some extra firepower. There were boosts, though, for Shane Duffy and Davy Pröpper who scored for the Republic of Ireland and Holland respectively. However, with Jonny Evans likely to make his first start, West Bromwich will be confident of extending Albion’s goal drought. Jack Kinnersley	1	0.48188553750514984,0.9995502829551697
1050	Everton	Tottenham Hotspur	0	3	09/09/2017	18	This is where it all started for Ronald Koeman, a 1-1 draw on the opening day of last season when Ross Barkley and Erik Lamela got the goals. Neither will feature this time and while Tottenham are bullish as Harry Kane moves into September, the Everton manager’s failure to sign a targetman means he will be hoping Wayne Rooney is not affected by his drink-driving charge. Mark Tallentire	-1	-0.0005277395248413086,0
1051	Leicester City	Chelsea	1	2	09/09/2017	18	A potentially tricky assignment for Chelsea, who could give Danny Drinkwater his debut at the home of his former club. Antonio Conte must also decide what sort of role Eden Hazard plays now he is available after returning from ankle surgery. Leicester are unable to call on the services of Adrien Silva, who remains in limbo after Fifa refused to approve his transfer from Sporting Lisbon. Robert Huth and Vicente Iborra are also sidelined, although Aleksandar Dragovic, signed on a season-long loan from Bayer Leverkusen, could feature. Stuart James	-1	-0.9805389046669006,-0.1869945526123047
1052	Manchester City	Liverpool	5	0	09/09/2017	18	This should be a feast of attacking play as Pep Guardiola’s possession-based tactics take on Jürgen Klopp’s aggressive forward line. Manchester City and Liverpool each harbour title hopes so this should offer a gauge of how close they may go. Last season’s corresponding match ended 1-1 and two years ago City suffered a 4-1 thrashing. Expect either manager to be jubilant with a mere 1-0 win. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.022440314292907715,0.9926568865776062
1053	Southampton	Watford	0	2	09/09/2017	18	Not for the first time, Southampton will have been glad to see the transfer window close. Virgil van Dijk is still at the club but this match will come too soon for him. The centre-back Wesley Hoedt could make his first appearance for Saints. The end of the window was less happy for Watford and following Nordin Amrabat’s unexpected departure André Carrillo may take his place on the wingFellow new signing Marvin Zeegelaar and the fit-again Daryl Janmaat and Younès Kaboul give Marco Silva more options in defence. Niall McVeigh	-1	-0.2887924909591675,-0.992617666721344
1054	Stoke City	Manchester United	2	2	09/09/2017	18	Ryan Shawcross’s back injury could lead to a debut for Stoke’s £18m centre-back, Kevin Wimmer. Even if the Austrian slots in well, United look to have the attacking power to find holes in the home defence, especially out wide. The probability, therefore, is that if Stoke are to disrupt United’s 100% start, then Jack Butland is going to have to show the form that has convinced many that he should be England’s No1.

1055	Burnley	Crystal Palace	1	0	10/09/2017	18	Burnley find themselves in the unusual position of still looking for their first home win, having won away at champions Chelsea and held Spurs to a draw at Wembley. They beat Crystal Palace home and away last season, though not easily, and are bound to find Frank de Boer’s side a different proposition, if only because the visitors are desperate to register their first points of the season, or even their first goal.

1056	Swansea City	Newcastle United	0	1	10/09/2017	18	A couple of welcome selection headaches for Paul Clement, who must decide whether Renato Sanches, who had his first Swansea training session on Friday, and Wilfried Bony, who has not made a Premier League appearance since December, should go straight into the team. Newcastle, in contrast, are not sure whether Rafael Benítez will be in the dugout to make any decisions – the Spaniard underwent surgery this week in relation to an infection following a hernia operation. Jonjo Shelvey, a former Swansea player, is available after serving a three-match ban. David Hytner	-1	0.9653173883756002,-0.9960624575614929
1057	Crystal Palace	Southampton	0	1	16/09/2017	18	The last time Southampton visited Selhurst Park they confronted a Crystal Palace managed by Alan Pardew and hurting from a six-game losing run. Fraser Forster gifted the hosts an early goal and Pardew won breathing space, albeit for only three weeks. Now, with Pardew, Sam Allardyce and Frank de Boer gone, Roy Hodgson will seek a result just as emphatic. Mauricio Pellegrino had been courted by Palace over the summer only to end up at St Mary’s. Given the upheaval of the last week, he may not know what to expect in south London. Dominic Fifield	-1	0.990298867225647,-0.00649552047252655
1058	Liverpool	Burnley	1	1	16/09/2017	18	The beginning of Sadio Mané’s three-match suspension opens the door for Philippe Coutinho to make his first start of the season for Liverpool, while Daniel Sturridge is also pushing for inclusion in a side that toiled without the injured Senegal international late last season. Burnley had to wait until 29 April for their first away win last season but they have already collected four points from trips to Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur. Adding to that tally at Anfield would compound a tough week for Jürgen Klopp. Andy Hunter	0	0.0034358203411102295,0.11353540420532227
1059	Newcastle United	Stoke City	2	1	16/09/2017	18	Rafael Benítez will be back in the Newcastle dugout after his hernia-related operation. His return means Mark Hughes can expect a warm welcome. José Mourinho may have declined to shake the Stoke manager’s hand last weekend but Benítez is a Hughes fan. “I don’t have any problems with Mark,” he said. “He’s a good manager, doing a great job. There won’t be any problems.” Louise Taylor	1	0.6449151635169983,0.9982885718345642
1060	Tottenham Hotspur	Swansea City	0	0	16/09/2017	18	Tottenham are flying after burying their Wembley jinx in the Champions League win over Borussia Dortmund while Swansea City have been gripped by introspection following their failure to perform against Newcastle United.

1061	Watford	Manchester City	0	6	16/09/2017	18	Given that Manchester City thrashed Watford 5-0 the last time they visited Vicarage Road, this one may seem a formality. In reality, the circumstances are entirely different this time round. Currently in fourth place with three clean sheets out of four, Watford should be difficult to break down. Indeed, Marco Silva’s side will go top of the league, for a day at least, if they were to win. Joe Cooper	-1	0.49408672749996185,0.9921736717224121
1062	West Brom	West Ham United	0	0	16/09/2017	18	Slaven Bilic gained a reprieve when his side beat Huddersfield on Monday but his future will be thrust back under the spotlight should West Ham lose at West Brom. Tony Pulis’s side are in need of a response after their good start to the season was derailed following a 3-1 defeat to Premier League newcomers Brighton and it could help that West Ham have conceded 10 goals in three away matches.

1063	Chelsea	Arsenal	0	0	17/09/2017	18	Arsenal have not won a league game at Stamford Bridge in six years. They will cling to the success gained against Antonio Conte’s side in the FA Cup final, and the Community Shield, but will surely find this a more daunting assignment. Chelsea have quietly been building up a head of steam, and they eased beyond Qarabag in midweek with key players rested and an eye on this derby. Conte will consider this an opportunity to make a statement in terms of his side’s title defence. Dominic Fifield	0	0.9959215323130289,-0.9947473406791687
1064	Manchester United	Everton	4	0	17/09/2017	18	The return of Wayne Rooney to Old Trafford gives the weekend’s final game a little extra glitter as does Romelu Lukaku, in blistering form, facing his former side. The issue though is whether Everton can arrest a run of three consecutive defeats against a Manchester United side out to return to winning ways in the league after their 2-2 draw at Stoke City.

1065	Burnley	Huddersfield	0	0	23/09/2017	18	Both these clubs would have been pleased to know at the start of the season that they would be involved in a top-half encounter in late September, with Huddersfield’s fine start to the season putting them fractionally ahead of a Burnley side looking comfortable in the top flight. The home side will be looking to bounce back after their Carabao Cup exit to Leeds United in midweek, as well as to re-establish fortress Turf Moor after picking up five of their eight points so far away from home.

1066	Everton	Bournemouth	2	1	23/09/2017	18	Back-to-back wins over Brighton will have lifted Bournemouth’s mood before their visit to Merseyside and Ronald Koeman urgently needs the same following a desperate run of form that has left Everton third from bottom. A more youthful, balanced Everton side ended a run of four defeats with victory over Sunderland in the Carabao Cup in midweek but Koeman is likely to ring the changes again, having viewed last Sunday’s 4-0 defeat at Manchester United as a step forward.

1067	Leicester City	Liverpool	2	3	23/09/2017	18	Liverpool visit Leicester City for the second time this week, after losing 2-0 in the Carabao Cup, and Jürgen Klopp has the task of arresting a poor run of two draws and two defeats with 10 goals conceded in all competitions. Craig Shakespeare is likely plotting a classic counter-attacking display from his side, to prey on their opponents frailties, and to record a third successive win against Liverpool for the first time since 1963. Graham Searles	-1	0,0.9991843104362488
1068	Manchester City	Crystal Palace	5	0	23/09/2017	18	Manchester City will surely not falter against a Crystal Palace side already on their second manager of the season – Roy Hodgson – and who have lost all five league matches scoring no goals. City are joint-top on 13 points and have a goal difference of 14, so expectations of a romp at the Etihad Stadium by Pep Guardiola’s team are realistic.

1069	Southampton	Manchester United	0	1	23/09/2017	18	Mauricio Pellegrino is up for the challenge of reining in Manchester United and may opt to start Virgil van Dijk in central defence, while striker Charlie Austin is available after a knock. Captain Steven Davis has called on Southampton fans to get behind them at a venue where United have won nine times in 12 visits. The trip to St. Mary’s is the first of six away games for United in the next month, and José Mourinho may seek to rotate his attacking options before the trip to CSKA Moscow, with Anthony Martial in form.

1071	Swansea City	Watford	1	2	23/09/2017	18	Contrasting results for these clubs last weekend, Swansea picked up a point at Wembley and Watford were hammered 6-0 at home by Manchester City. Marco Silva’s side, however, have won both of their away games this season while Swansea are pointless and goalless at home. Paul Clement could decide to give Wilfried Bony his first start since returning and Roque Mesa is also pushing for a starting place. Watford, meanwhile, are still without Sebastian Prödl and Younes Kaboul, both of whom are injured, and the suspended Miguel Britos. Stuart James	-1	-0.0036774277687072754,0.3042810757954915
1072	West Ham United	Tottenham Hotspur	2	3	23/09/2017	18	West Ham United ended Tottenham Hotspur’s title challenge last season, Manuel Lanzini scoring the only goal on a boisterous Friday night at the London Stadium. But Lanzini’s unavailability boosts Tottenham’s chances of revenge. While West Ham have kept three consecutive clean sheets, Mauricio Pochettino’s side have won their first two away games without conceding a goal.

1073	Brighton	Newcastle United	1	0	24/09/2017	18	The two automatically-promoted sides play at the Amex Stadium with Newcastle, who have won three in a row, are five points ahead of a home side that lost from a leading position at Bournemouth last time out. Has their impressive form merely masked Rafael Benítez’s transfer window frustrations or is something significant gathering speed? Their former manager, Chris Hughton, will put that to the test and Brighton will need to beknow his side need to be as good as they were in their last home game, when Pascal Gross inspired them to a 3-1 win over West Brom.

1074	Arsenal	West Brom	2	0	25/09/2017	18	Arsène Wenger said it all with one of those half-suppressed smirks. “West Brom has a way to deal with everybody,” he said and by that, he meant Tony Pulis has a way to deal with everybody. Wenger vs Pulis is the ultimate clash of styles and how Wenger has suffered in away matches against his rival. The Emirates story is different. Wenger’s record there against Pulis teams reads: played 10, won 10. David Hytner	1	0.3234156171480815,-0.7443342208862305
1075	Bournemouth	Leicester City	0	0	30/09/2017	18	Both managers have called for patience before a meeting between two of the league’s bottom four. Eddie Howe will be without Harry Arter and Tyrone Mings, but Callum Wilson has returned to training after a second serious knee injury. Like Howe, Craig Shakespeare can point to respectable performances in tricky fixtures so far, but Leicester will fall into the relegation zone with defeat on the south coast. Jamie Vardy is set to be available despite a hip problem, having scored three goals in six appearances against Bournemouth. Niall McVeigh	0	0.15317130088806152,-0.9916945099830627
1076	Chelsea	Manchester City	0	1	30/09/2017	18	Chelsea’s complaints about a lack of recovery time after Wednesday’s eye-catching success at Atlético Madrid have been overshadowed somewhat by the untimely loss to injury of Benjamin Mendy and Sergio Agüero for Manchester City. Yet the visitors will still arrive at Stamford Bridge brimming with attacking intent, and Antonio Conte’s side, rejigged or not, will need to rescale the heights of their display at the Wanda Metropolitano to check the leaders’ progress. The suspicion is this could actually end up as fascinating a duel between Conte and Pep Guardiola as the players out on the field. Dominic Fifield	-1	-0.3564344048500061,0
1077	Manchester United	Crystal Palace	4	0	30/09/2017	18	Manchester United’s season could not have started much better and Crystal Palace’s much worse. United are fresh from Wednesday’s emphatic 4-1 over CSKA Moscow and are second in thePremier L eague only on goal difference, while Palace still search for a first goal and first point after suffering a 5-0 hammering at Manchester City last Saturday. There should, surely, be only one result. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.0287284255027771,0
1078	Stoke City	Southampton	2	1	30/09/2017	18	Stoke City are still severely depleted in defence, with only Kurt Zouma at full fitness, and will likely struggle as they did last week against Chelsea. Mark Hughes does have hope in Southampton’s inability to score with any frequency but his crisis may be the jolt Mauricio Pellegrino’s attackers need to spark them into life. If Stoke do lose again they risk falling into the relegation zone. Graham Searles	1	-0.9965138137340546,0.9805289506912231
1079	West Brom	Watford	2	2	30/09/2017	18	After a strong start to the season Tony Pulis’s predictable score and shut-up-shop tactics are failing West Brom. In all competitions they have scored more than one goal once in eight attempts and that was against Accrington Stanley. Pulis was adamant his side deserved more at Arsenal but the Welshman’s protestations mask his side’s lack of creativity. Watford have no such problem and will be confident they can maintain their impeccable away form, that has yielded nine points from nine, despite missing Nathaniel Chalobah, who requires knee surgery after fracturing a patella.

1080	West Ham United	Swansea City	1	0	30/09/2017	18	Slaven Bilic finds himself under far more pressure than Paul Clement even though West Ham only lie a point below Swansea. Bilic desperately needs a win after last week’s defeat to Tottenham and it is likely to be a tense afternoon at the London Stadium. Swansea have lacked a goal threat this season, but they held Spurs and have been tough to break down away from home. Jacob Steinberg	1	-0.7413477897644043,0.9788678884506226
1081	Everton	Burnley	0	1	01/10/2017	18	The home draw with Apollon Limassol drew the same criticisms for Ronald Koeman that have been around all season and which last Saturday were masked by Oumar Niasse’s late goals against Bournemouth. Thus, for most, the pacy Ademola Lookman and Kevin Mirrallas cannot start soon enough. The defence is out of form too, and Burnley will fancy their chances.

1082	Burnley	West Ham United	1	1	14/10/2017	18	Burnley’s best start to a top flight season since 1975 has been fuelled mostly by points gained away from home, surprising considering their meagre haul on their travels last season. Sean Dyche will need to record his first Premier League win over West Ham to restore Turf Moor to the fortress it once was, Slaven Bilic’s side have won all four meetings in Burnley’s last couple of seasons at the top level.

1083	Crystal Palace	Chelsea	2	1	14/10/2017	18	Chelsea’s momentum had been checked impressively by Manchester City just before the international break but this fixture should provide an opportunity to rediscover lost rhythm. Even in the absence of Álvaro Morata and N’Golo Kanté, they will travel south across the capital and confident Crystal Palace, pointless and scoreless to date, can be overcome. The hosts must do without Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Christian Benteke, but will at least be bolstered by the return of Wilfried Zaha and possibly Julian Speroni to their ranks. At some point they must revive. It may be too much to ask for the recovery to start against Chelsea. Dominic Fifield	1	0.9182394742965698,-0.09965291619300842
1084	Liverpool	Manchester United	0	0	14/10/2017	18	José Mourinho is well equipped to exploit Liverpool’s weaknesses with the power, organisation and counter-attacking style of his joint league leaders but that would require a different strategy to what he successfully employed at Anfield last season. Marouane Fellaini and Paul Pogba are big misses for Manchester United but Sadio Mané’s absence will be felt by Jürgen Klopp, too. Liverpool’s performances have not been as bad as recent results indicate but they can ill-afford to fall 10 points behind their arch rivals so early in the season. Both sides have opportunity to deliver a statement of intent. Andy Hunter	0	-0.3155808051427205,-0.9790390133857727
1085	Manchester City	Stoke City	7	2	14/10/2017	18	Manchester City resume with Sergio Agüero back in contention following the rib injury suffered in a car accident. Factor in how Pep Guardiola’s side beat Chelsea without the striker and they could not be rolling any smoother. A caveat can always be found though: in last season’s corresponding fixture Stoke achieved a creditable 0-0 draw so Mark Hughes knows how to gain a result at the Etihad.

1086	Tottenham Hotspur	Bournemouth	1	0	14/10/2017	18	It is a big week for Tottenham Hotspur, with the glamour Champions League tie at Real Madrid on Tuesday and a visit from Liverpool next Sunday but Mauricio Pochettino will not look beyond Bournemouth – and the chance to win at Wembley in the league for the first time. Eddie Howe is not the type to park the bus, which is a good thing for Tottenham. The Bournemouth manager maintains his team can play their way out of trouble.

1087	Watford	Arsenal	2	1	14/10/2017	18	Watford and Arsenal are out of their comfort zones. Marco Silva’s side have not won yet at home and Arsène Wenger’s have not won away from the Emirates. However, it is surely Arsenal that should be more confident, despite in all likelihood missing Alexis Sánchez, of breaking their duck after not conceding a league goal in September. Petr Cech will need to be at his best to keep another clean sheet though as Richarlison is going to be eager to continue impressing. Graham Searles	1	0.03479465842247009,0.1709921956062317
1088	Brighton	Everton	1	1	15/10/2017	18	Brighton sense a chance to make headway over the next month with West Ham United, Southampton and Swansea City their opponents after the visit of vulnerable Everton. Then again international breaks can sometimes provide timely punctuation and Ronald Koeman will hope his team come out refreshed after taking stock of a deeply unimpressive and troubling September. The television audience in India, who are the beneficiaries of this game’s switch to 1.30pm on Sunday, will doubtless be hoping for a rousing contest too. Everton’s travelling fans would be forgiven for focusing their attention on this latest demonstration of the Premier League’s priorities. Nick Ames	0	0,0.7925788164138794
1089	Southampton	Newcastle United	2	2	15/10/2017	18	Mauricio Pellegrino has endured an indifferent start at Southampton but begins a forgiving run of fixtures with the visit of Newcastle and Rafa Benítez, whom he worked under at Liverpool and Internazionale. Pellegrino has no new injury concerns after the international break, with Shane Long recovering from a hip problem. Newcastle are boosted by the permanent signing of the midfielder Mikel Merino while Jonjo Shelvey is available despite a finger injury. Niall McVeigh	0	-0.7074289619922638,0.9992615580558777
1090	Leicester City	West Brom	1	1	16/10/2017	18	Leicester have had a tricky start to the season in terms of fixtures but their ambitious owners would still have hoped for more than five points from seven matches. The combination of Danny Drinkwater’s late departure and the embarrassing mix-up over the signing of Adrien Silva has left Leicester light in midfield, yet other areas of the team are also not clicking. West Brom, in contrast, were quick out of the blocks, picking up seven points from their first three matches, but have failed to win since. Stuart James	0	-0.016290247440338135,-0.9923904538154602
1091	Chelsea	Watford	4	2	21/10/2017	18	Chelsea have dropped eight points at home this season, already two more than last season, and confront fourth-placed Watford with only one fully fit senior midfielder. Antonio Conte’s side are clearly struggling to adapt to the fixture clutter generated by the Champions League. The visitors’ start will be fuelling their own European desires, with Watford having taken 10 points from four away games to date. This suddenly feels a distinctly awkward fixture for the defending champions. Dominic Fifield	1	-0.996751070022583,0.9978639483451843
1092	Manchester City	Burnley	3	0	21/10/2017	18	Burnley are 30-1 to beat Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium due to the Premier League leaders dropping just two points, scoring 29 goals, and blitzing last week’s visitors, Stoke City, 7-2. But Sean Dyche is a shrewd manager and while a victory would be a surprise it would be no shock, given they have already won at Stamford Bridge and drawn at Anfield this season. Jamie Jackson	1	0,0.9823063015937805
1093	Newcastle United	Crystal Palace	1	0	21/10/2017	18	Andros Townsend may regard this as an audition for a potential January return to Tyneside as he and his Palace team-mates try to reprise last week’s long-awaited win against Chelsea. Townsend’s old manager, Rafael Benítez, may be more concerned by Wilfried Zaha as he aims to ensure Newcastle bolster the feel-good factor engendered by much fevered take-over talk and collect three points themselves. Roy Hodgson describes Zaha as his “talisman” but Palace’s challenge is to prove they are no one man team. Louise Taylor	1	0.9923869371414185,0.3107393980026245
1094	Southampton	West Brom	1	0	21/10/2017	18	These two sides are sitting in mid-table but may feel under pressure by kick-off, when all but one of the teams below them will have played. Southampton have won only once at St Mary’s this season, while West Brom are winless in their past six league games. Mauricio Pellegrino will be looking for a repeat performance from the inconsistent Manolo Gabbiadini after his double against Newcastle, while goalkeepers Ben Foster and Boaz Myhill both face late fitness tests for the visitors. Niall McVeigh	1	-0.9279852310816447,0
1095	Stoke City	Bournemouth	1	2	21/10/2017	18	Mark Hughes believes that Stoke are doing “slightly better” than expected, after coming through a “difficult period” in which they played Arsenal, Chelsea and both Manchester clubs. Bournemouth have lost six of their eight matches but, after a tough game last week at Spurs, Eddie Howe will look to use tactics that kept Harry Kane and Dele Alli quiet to get a positive result against Stoke.

1096	Swansea City	Leicester City	1	2	21/10/2017	18	With Leicester City winless in six games, 18th in the league and without a manager this is a huge opportunity for Swansea City to capitalise and record their third win of the season. In-form Tammy Abraham should relish going up against a Leicester defence that has conceded nine in their barren run. It is likely to be an uphill struggle for Leicester with the players reportedly unhappy about Craig Shakespeare’s sacking. Robin Sargeson	-1	0,-0.3001737395922343
1097	Everton	Arsenal	2	5	22/10/2017	18	Beating Arsenal at home last season was a turning point for Everton, who went into that 2-1 victory on the back of one win in 11 matches. Ronald Koeman’s side enter the corresponding fixture having won twice in 12 games and with their manager under intense pressure, though it is hard to envisage the repeat that Koeman desperately needs when looking at the attacking options at his disposal. Arsenal require a reaction of their own having been bullied into submission yet again at Watford last weekend. Andy Hunter	-1	0.9700576066970825,-0.855421781539917
1098	Tottenham Hotspur	Liverpool	4	1	22/10/2017	18	After last week’s bore draw against Manchester United it was important for Liverpool to get a good result in the Champions League and they will look to carry this momentum forward against Spurs. Mauricio Pochettino is happy with Tottenham’s performances, as there were many positives from their draw with Real Madrid at the Bernabéu. It will be tough for Liverpool to beat Spurs, who are undefeated in their past six games. Robin Sargeson	1	0.9998594522476196,0.9995689988136292
1099	Arsenal	Swansea City	2	1	28/10/2017	18	Swansea have developed the reputation as a tough nut to crack and it has not gone unnoticed at Arsenal that they have conceded only once on their Premier League travels this season. Arsène Wenger knows that patience will be a virtue but he has demanded that his players show pace and positivity in order to preserve Arsenal’s “impeccable” home record. After a few crashes away from home, he knows the margin for error is zero. David Hytner	1	-0.8610569834709167,0.9991612434387207
1100	Bournemouth	Chelsea	0	1	28/10/2017	18	Antonio Conte will be thankful Richarlison’s profligacy let Chelsea avoid a catastrophic third successive league defeat last week and the Italian will demand improvement against Bournemouth. Eddie Howe is pleased by his side’s upturn in form but even more will need to be squeezed from his players to avoid defeat. Jermain Defoe’s opportunity to score a 200th league goal could be the extra drop required. Graham Searles	-1	0.8661677986383438,0
1101	Crystal Palace	West Ham United	2	2	28/10/2017	18	Despite the struggles for both sides, there have been reasons for optimism recently. West Ham’s dramatic comeback at Wembley on Wednesday lifted some pressure on Slaven Bilic while Crystal Palace are back at Selhurst Park for the first time since defeating champions Chelsea. West Ham, as one of four sides still winless away, will be hoping their cup form translates to the league. Jack Mumford	0	0.9989062547683716,0.1048588752746582
1102	Manchester United	Tottenham Hotspur	1	0	28/10/2017	18	The loss of Harry Kane is a blow for Tottenham and a huge boost for Manchester United. As Manchester City are five points ahead of United and Spurs, second and third respectively, a draw is surely undesirable and given the loss of Spurs’ star striker the onus is on José Mourinho’s men to go for the win. Considering Mourinho’s use of cat-and-mouse tactics it remains to be seen if he will instruct his side to do so. Jamie Jackson	1	0.02197819948196411,0.9970260262489319
1103	Watford	Stoke City	0	1	28/10/2017	18	Watford’s defeat in last week’s thriller at Stamford Bridge was perhaps harsh on Marco Silva’s side but it has done little to dampen their belief that this could be a special season at Vicarage Road. The mood is much more solemn for Stoke City, sitting just above the relegation zone; they are yet to win away from home in this campaign. If Watford can match the energy they have displayed so far, the visitor’s barren run on the road may continue. Jack Mumford	-1	-0.005296677350997925,-0.9411705732345581
1104	West Brom	Manchester City	2	3	28/10/2017	18	West Brom’s eight-match winless run, in all competitions, stretches back to August and one expects for it to continue against Manchester City. Pep Guardiola made nine changes in midweek, against Wolves, and will want his key men to return to the West Midlands in relentless fashion. Tony Pulis’s only hope could be parking the bus but, without Craig Dawson and possibly Jonny Evans, that is likely to be a serious challenge. Graham Searles	-1	-0.9772447347640991,-0.9686998128890991
1105	Brighton	Southampton	1	1	29/10/2017	18	The sides came out of League One together as recently as 2011 and are currently sitting in mid-table, which lowers the tariff slightly and may lead to an entertaining game which both will consider winnable. They have met only once before at the Amex, Brighton winning 3-0 in the Championship, and with seven points from their last four games Albion will fancy a repeat. Mark Tallentire	0	0.9994871616363525,0
1106	Leicester City	Everton	2	0	29/10/2017	18	Two of the three Premier League clubs to have sacked their manager this season go head-to-head in the east Midlands as Claude Puel takes charge of Leicester for the first time and David Unsworth seeks the victory that would strengthen his chances of a landing the Everton job permanently. Puel seems likely to keep faith with the Leicester team that ended a six-game winless run with victory at Swansea, which means Shinji Okazaki will play just off Jamie Vardy. Idrissa Gueye is back from suspension for Everton. Stuart James	1	0.9967651069164276,0.7987297177314758
1107	Burnley	Newcastle United	1	0	30/10/2017	18	Sean Dyche marks five years in charge at Burnley hoping for just a second home win of the season, against Newcastle. So far Dyche’s side have beaten only Crystal Palace at Turf Moor, and have now slipped below Rafa Benítez’s team in the table. Newcastle will be confident after drawing their last two away matches, and with two conservative defences a draw seems the most likely result on Monday.

1108	Newcastle United	Bournemouth	0	1	04/11/2017	18	As Amanda Staveley’s proposed takeover inches closer, Newcastle fans dream of Champions League nights. Meanwhile their team could do with beating Bournemouth. With games against Huddersfield, Swansea and Burnley on the horizon, Simon Francis, Eddie Howe’s captain, has described November as “a make or break month”. The bad news for Howe is that Premier League Saturday matches at home suit Rafael Benítez, he has won his last 31 such fixtures, the most recent five during his Newcastle tenure.

1109	Southampton	Burnley	0	1	04/11/2017	18	Burnley have lost just once on their travels this season and will go level on points with Chelsea and Arsenal if they win at St Mary’s. That might be easier said than done, with speculation growing that Sean Dyche is set to depart for Everton. Chris Wood faces a late fitness test on his hamstring, while Steven Defour should be available. For the hosts, Charlie Austin has recovered from a knock but Mario Lemina is out until after the international break. Mauricio Pellegrino’s side have lacked consistency, but could stretch their unbeaten run to four games if the visitors prove to be distracted.

1110	Stoke City	Leicester City	2	2	04/11/2017	18	Claude Puel’s tenure as Southampton manager ended with a home defeat by Stoke City and now he will attempt to avenge that and extend his positive start with Leicester City. It will be interesting to see whether he changes the lineup that defeated Everton last Sunday. Stoke also go into the game in high spirits and hope to achieve back-to-back league wins for the first time this season. Paul Doyle	0	0.9998229146003723,0.9934497475624084
1111	Swansea City	Brighton	0	1	04/11/2017	18	This feels like a must-win game for Swansea who are outside the relegation zone only on goal difference and have lost four of their five home league games this season. They will be missing Renato Sanches, Martin Olsson and Leon Britton but Wilfried Bony has a chance of making the bench. Brighton, who look more comfortable in the Premier League after a run that has gleaned eight points from their past five matches, promise to be awkward opponents.

1112	West Ham United	Liverpool	1	4	04/11/2017	18	A fortnight on from that thumping by Tottenham, Liverpool have a spring in their step again after successive 3-0 home wins over Huddersfield and Maribor. They won 4-0 at the London Stadium last season and will back themselves to overcome the absence of Philippe Coutinho against a West Ham side who have been hit by an injury crisis in defence. Slaven Bilic’s strugglers are without James Collins, José Fonte and Sam Byram, while Pablo Zabaleta is suspended. Jacob Steinberg	-1	0.00038492679595947266,0.9984184503555298
1113	Chelsea	Manchester United	1	0	05/11/2017	18	It will be fascinating to see whether José Mourinho arrives back at Stamford Bridge with caution on his mind given Chelsea’s defeat in Rome in midweek suggested the champions are there for the taking. Antonio Conte, stung personally by that embarrassment, has conducted his own debrief and will expect a response from his side, but so much hinges on how N’Golo Kanté trains on Saturday and whether he declares himself fit to feature. The return of Nemanja Matic and, to a lesser extent, Juan Mata add another layer of intrigue to a potentially combustible occasion. Dominic Fifield	1	0.005367845296859741,0
1114	Everton	Watford	3	2	05/11/2017	18	Everton are in free-fall before what could be David Unsworth’s final game as caretaker manager. Ten defeats in 14 matches embarrass an expensive squad and those who assembled it, and fear will deepen around Goodison Park should Marco Silva’s Watford inflict an 11th. Unsworth has suffered three defeats in three difficult away fixtures with a hectic schedule disrupting his search for a settled side. Goodison will be firmly behind the club’s popular former defender but the unknown is whether Everton’s highly-paid, experienced players will finally take responsibility for the slide.

City, though, are flying with the manager particularly content with the goal tally – 49 in all competitions – and the mental strength of his players. Arsenal are nine points behind and if they wish to be in the title race they need to win at the Etihad Stadium. Jamie Jackson	1	0.9995948672294617,0.9627906382083893
1116	Tottenham Hotspur	Crystal Palace	1	0	05/11/2017	18	It doesn’t get any easier for Roy Hodgson and Crystal Palace. His schedule since taking over from Frank de Boer has seen meetings with the Manchester clubs and Chelsea, and now he runs into a Tottenham team flying after their midweek Champions League triumph against Real Madrid. Hodgson will take inspiration from the way that Palace upset the odds to beat Chelsea while Tottenham will be wary of Wilfried Zaha, a player they would love to sign.

1117	Arsenal	Tottenham Hotspur	2	0	18/11/2017	18	Tottenham will make the short trip to the Emirates more confident than ever of showing they are the dominant force in north London. Spurs have the x-factor in Harry Kane who has never failed to score against Arsenal in the league. Arsène Wenger, who boasts 10 consecutive league wins at home, needs to come up with a plan to stop the striker, who is rested after missing England duty.

1118	Burnley	Swansea City	2	0	18/11/2017	18	Only Manchester City have managed to beat Burnley in their past nine league games, a run of results that has taken the Clarets to within goal difference of the top six. That sort of form has brought Sean Dyche to the nation’s attention and ought to be enough to see off struggling Swansea, though the Welsh side have to be looking to take points from Burnley and should have Renato Sanches and Wilfried Bony back after injury.

1119	Crystal Palace	Everton	2	2	18/11/2017	18	These sides’ miserable starts cost them managers. Everton still wait to make a permanent appointment but they are in better shape now than a few weeks ago and ended an eight-match winless run just before the international break. They have also reintegrated Morgan Schneiderlin and Kevin Mirallas to the squad. Crystal Palace’s points tally for the season has been gleaned from their last two home fixtures, while Christian Benteke is fit again. Both teams will consider this an opportunity to maintain their recovery. Dominic Fifield	0	-0.0005709826946258545,0.9914969503879547
1120	Leicester City	Manchester City	0	2	18/11/2017	18	What chance a repeat of last season? Leicester beat Manchester City 4-2 on that occasion, with Jamie Vardy scoring a hat-trick as Pep Guardiola’s side somewhat naively played into the hands of the then Premier League champions. Now City are an entirely different proposition and it is hard to see how anyone can stop a team that is unbeaten in 23 matches and scoring goals at a ridiculous rate. City will, however, have to make do without the suspended key defender Nicolás Otamendi at the King Power Stadium. Stuart James	-1	0.8947772979736328,-0.011887222528457642
1121	Liverpool	Southampton	3	0	18/11/2017	18	Jürgen Klopp has not beaten Southampton in four league meetings but, after three straight wins in all competitions and with his squad nearing full fitness, he said: “Now is a good moment to strike back.” Adam Lallana, who is yet to make an appearance this season, is unlikely to feature against his old club but Sadio Mané could play after a hamstring scare. Mauricio Pellegrino, who played 13 times for Liverpool in 2005, has maintained Southampton’s defensive discipline, since replacing Claude Puel, but scoring has been a struggle. His team have conceded and scored only three goals away from home this term. Andy Hunter	1	-0.9789113998413086,-0.31750152508417767

Their last outing was the defeat at Chelsea and, given how shrewd Rafael Benítez is, Newcastle United may provide a real test at Old Trafford. But Paul Pogba, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marcos Rojo are all back in the match-day squad to give United a considerable boost and if they are to genuinely challenge for the title, José Mourinho’s side really have to win.

Unfortunately he will be without the club’s top scorer, Javier Hernández, who was injured playing for Mexico. Despite Moyes’s emphasis on improved work ethic, Marco Silva will probably look to apply as much pressure on West Ham’s porous defence as possible to stop a run of three defeats.

Lee Grant starts in place of the injured Jack Butland for Stoke and Murray will be relishing facing the replacement, especially as Stoke have conceded an average of two goals a game this season and just one fewer in total than the league’s worst tally.

Roy Hodgson has overseen significantly improved performances over his side’s past five matches, yet the team have still won only once all term and are adrift at the foot playing catch-up from that wretched start. Stoke City, who have not won at Selhurst Park in a decade and are enduring their own inconsistencies, must surely be overcome if Palace’s confidence is to be bolstered before Tuesday’s derby at Brighton. This may be the time to fling Christian Benteke back into the fray from the start. Dominic Fifield	1	-0.9493872324625651,0
1127	Liverpool	Chelsea	1	1	25/11/2017	18	Antonio Conte conducted preparations for Anfield on the flight home from Qarabag as Chelsea managed only one full training session before travelling to Liverpool. For the home side, post-Champions League fatigue may be more in mind than body after blowing a three-goal lead against Sevilla on Tuesday. A home win will take Jürgen Klopp’s side level on points with the champions but, Crystal Palace apart, Chelsea have impressed on the road this season – collecting 15 points from a possible 18 on their travels compared to 10 at Stamford Bridge. Mohamed Salah’s form will worry his old club. Andy Hunter	0	-0.9977591037750244,0

1129	Newcastle United	Watford	0	3	25/11/2017	18	Takeover talk has reached fever pitch on Tyneside but, before Newcastle can be transformed by hundreds of Middle Eastern millions, Mike Ashley must accept an offer from Amanda Staveley. Until that happens there is a sense of limbo; not that Rafa Benítez can allow Newcastle, who have lost their past three games, to tread water. An intriguing tactical duel between Benítez and Watford’s Marco Silva – (much admired by managerless Everton) – will be spiced by the return of Newcastle’s Mikel Merino from injury.

1130	Swansea City	Bournemouth	0	0	25/11/2017	18	The pressure is building on Paul Clement and, although the Swansea manager is confident his job is not on the line, another defeat would be a huge blow, especially with a trip to Chelsea to come on Wednesday. Tammy Abraham will have to miss that game because of his loan agreement and is also a major doubt against Bournemouth because of a back problem. Eddie Howe’s side, with three wins from their past four league games, appear resurgent and will fancy their chances. Stuart James	0	-0.997019350528717,0.33152492841084796
1131	Tottenham Hotspur	West Brom	1	1	25/11/2017	18	Gary Megson has had a busy week as West Brom’s caretaker. He reshuffled the backroom staff and told the assistant, Ben Garner, to stay away, and is now trying to get a tune out of a team with four draws and six defeats from the last 10. Spurs at Wembley would not have been his game of choice either, even if he last featured there as a player with Sheffield Wednesday in 1988. Mark Tallentire	0	-0.9944992065429688,-0.9800972938537598
1132	Burnley	Arsenal	0	1	26/11/2017	18	Arsenal have not lost in their six Premier League meetings with Burnley to date, though Sean Dyche can only be encouraged by going into this meeting level on points with Arsène Wenger’s side (and Liverpool) in late November. Fresh from victory in the north London derby, Arsenal will be hoping for more of the same at Turf Moor, yet Burnley could be fresher still by virtue of not having played in the Europa League. Paul Wilson	-1	0,0.9867275953292847
1133	Huddersfield	Manchester City	1	2	26/11/2017	18	Christopher Schindler is Huddersfield’s best defender and the German makes a timely return from suspension, but it will still take something special for Huddersfield to neutralise the fearsome attacking power of Manchester City. David Wagner’s side have already toppled Manchester United at home this season but a repeat performance is a tall order against a City team who have won all of their away matches this season.

1134	Southampton	Everton	4	1	26/11/2017	18	Something’s got to give at St Mary’s as sShot-shy Southampton take on porous Everton. The visitors’ interim manager, David Unsworth, challenged his reshuffled Europa League team to give him a selection dilemma but Wayne Rooney, Sandro and Davy Klaassen weakened their case in the 5-1 defeat. Mauricio Pellegrino is under growing pressure with three league wins all season and may fast-track Mario Lemina back into his team with Oriel Romeu suspended. These sides were the “best of the rest” last season; that seems like a long time ago. Niall McVeigh	1	-0.30985748767852783,-0.9968666434288025
1135	Arsenal	Manchester United	1	3	02/12/2017	18	Arsène Wenger will be disappointed to be without the services of Alexandre Lacazette but with Mesut Özil’s magical range of passing the manager can at least be confident the striker’s replacement should have chances. José Mourinho will want more from Romelu Lukaku but the Belgian’s struggles may continue. Wenger’s side have been growing stronger defensively and in doing so have kept three successive clean sheets.

1136	Brighton	Liverpool	1	5	02/12/2017	18	Events off the field overshadowed Brighton’s stalemate with Crystal Palace on Tuesday, their fourth consecutive draw at home. Only Manchester City have left the Amex Stadium with three points this season. Jürgen Klopp made six changes for the win at Stoke on Wednesday and is likely to shuffle his pack again. After starting the past two games Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is finding his feet at Anfield. Tim Knowles	-1	0.9765816529591879,-0.001818835735321045
1137	Chelsea	Newcastle United	3	1	02/12/2017	18	Chelsea have dropped only two points since that slapdash defeat at Selhurst Park in October and can unleash Eden Hazard back into the fray after the Belgian featured for only nine minutes in the midweek win over Swansea. Newcastle, in contrast, have won only once since September and boast a solitary victory at Stamford Bridge since 1986. Their comeback at the Hawthorns on Tuesday offers some cause for optimism but Rafael Benítez, a Europa League winner as Chelsea’s interim manager, is braced for an awkward return.

1138	Leicester City	Burnley	1	0	02/12/2017	18	The closest-looking game of the weekend with all three results eminently feasible, resurgent Leicester will expect to win it all the same after snuffing out the title ambitions of Spurs in midweek. Three places above them in sixth place, Burnley have had tougher away games already and apart from the loss at Manchester City have returned from the others with at least a point.

1139	Stoke City	Swansea City	2	1	02/12/2017	18	Mark Hughes has admitted this is a must-win match for Stoke City who badly need to reverse the downward spiral in which they seem locked. The same can be said of Paul Clement’s Swansea City who have failed to win in their past six attempts and for whom Wilfried Bony could not make a more timely return to form.

1140	Watford	Tottenham Hotspur	1	1	02/12/2017	18	In remarkably similar pre-match analyses Marco Silva stressed Watford, who have lost four of their last six, need to “be smart”, “more mature” and “make the right decisions”, while Mauricio Pochettino said Spurs, who have lost their last three away, must “be calm” and not “take decisions with emotion”. Only a win by six or more can stop Watford ending the day in eighth. Simon Burnton	0	-0.23785130182902017,0
1141	West Brom	Crystal Palace	0	0	02/12/2017	18	Alan Pardew’s first game in charge of West Brom, perhaps inevitably, is against the last team he managed. Crystal Palace showed Pardew the door three days before Christmas last year as they struggled near the bottom of the league but the Baggies’ board clearly believe he has not lost all his powers of motivation and resuscitation as the festive programme approaches.

1142	Bournemouth	Southampton	1	1	03/12/2017	18	Goals have been fairly scarce for both these sides so far, although Southampton did help themselves to four against Everton last weekend. Eddie Howe will be hoping Josh King – who currently has more goals for Norway (three) than Premier League goals (two) this season – finds form as he did in 2016-17 when 14 of his 16 Bournemouth strikes came after the start of December.

1143	Manchester City	West Ham United	2	1	03/12/2017	18	If Pep Guardiola could choose a team against whom to try to gain a 20th win on the trot he might well pick West Ham. David Moyes’s side suffered a 4-0 humiliation at fellow-strugglers Everton in mid-week, which included Wayne Rooney’s wonder goal, and will surely not fancy facing Manchester City away. If Manchester United win at Arsenal on Saturday it may put some pressure on Guardiola’s side but, really, they should still defeat West Ham whatever may have happened.

1144	Burnley	Watford	1	0	09/12/2017	18	The Premier League’s surprise duo meet at Turf Moor and eighth-placed Watford could draw level with their high-flying hosts with a victory. Both clubs have managed to hang on to their in-demand managers, Sean Dyche and Marco Silva, but the former has not been helped by the serious knee injury to Robbie Brady at Leicester last Saturday which could rule him out for the season. Paul Chronnell	1	-0.9935491681098938,0
1145	Crystal Palace	Bournemouth	2	2	09/12/2017	18	Roy Hodgson’s Crystal Palace are much improved and off the foot of the table – no mean feat since they are without an away league goal since April – but their precarious predicament means they cannot afford to pass up the chance to build on recent momentum against an inconsistent Bournemouth. The visitors have not lost at Selhurst Park since 1988 but, with Adam Smith suspended, will be wary of the threat posed by Wilfried Zaha with Palace having scored twice in each of their last four home games.

1146	Newcastle United	Leicester City	2	3	09/12/2017	18	Newcastle United hope to celebrate the 125th anniversary of their formation by arresting a dismal run which has seen them collect one point from six games. If the return of Christian Atsu - a winger possessing the pace collectively lacking in the side - and captain Jamaal Lascelles is welcome, Rafael Benitez’s players will need to be mindful of Leicester’s dangerous counter-attacking. With Sam Allardyce’s Everton in Toon on Wednesday and Mike Ashley having discussed a club sale over a Hampstead curry with Amanda Staveley this is a potentially pivotal week on Tyneside. Louise Taylor	-1	0.331291397412618,0.9832514524459839
1147	Swansea City	West Brom	1	0	09/12/2017	18	Having gone bottom of the table Paul Clement will be desperate for a result against a West Brom side that have already pulled the trigger on their under-fire manager Tony Pulis. Alan Pardew has since stepped into the breach but on his last visit to Swansea a late collapse condemned his old Crystal Palace side to an astonishing 5-4 defeat – he’ll be hoping for better luck with his new club.

1148	Tottenham Hotspur	Stoke City	5	1	09/12/2017	18	Spurs are looking to end a run of four without a win in the Premier League as they welcome Stoke City to Wembley. Last week the Potters ended their own four-match sequence without a victory – but having lost their last three against Tottenham 4-0, could face the ignominy of becoming the first side in Premier League history to lose by four goals or more to a side four times in a row. Étienne Fermie	1	-0.981360673904419,-0.9899409413337708
1149	West Ham United	Chelsea	1	0	09/12/2017	18	Although West Ham remain winless under David Moyes, who is set to keep Adrián in goal in place of Joe Hart, there were signs of improvement during last Sunday’s 2-1 defeat at Manchester City. West Ham still have plenty of injury concerns and Chelsea come into this match in excellent form. Eden Hazard could increase the suffering for Moyes’s strugglers. Jacob Steinberg	1	0.0012523829936981201,0
1150	Liverpool	Everton	1	1	10/12/2017	18	A sense of calm may have descended on Everton after three consecutive wins and clean sheets but Anfield brings one of trepidation and not only on account of their appalling record across Stanley Park. Jürgen Klopp is the only Liverpool manager in history to win his first three derbies, his team have plundered 12 goals in two games and look perfectly equipped to prey on Everton’s many weaknesses. Sam Allardyce has a decent derby record overall but it will require a stunning transformation – from both sides – to trouble Liverpool’s unbeaten home run against their rivals, one that stands at 17 league games.

1151	Manchester United	Manchester City	1	2	10/12/2017	18	The showdown of the season so far. Despite each manager’s public platitudes José Mourinho and Pep Guardiola know a victory for their side will have a seismic effect on the title race. If the Portuguese’s Manchester United can cut the gap to five points it gives them belief and boosts Chelsea, who are a further three points back. Lose and the Catalan’s Manchester City would return to their base in the east of the city cock a-hoop due to a near four-wins advantage. Jamie Jackson	-1	0.997649610042572,0.9347209930419922
1152	Southampton	Arsenal	1	1	10/12/2017	18	Recent games between these two sides on the south coast have produced some emphatic scorelines – Southampton won 4-0 on Boxing Day two years ago to throw Arsenal’s title challenge into disarray, but in two trips to St Mary’s in 2017, Arsenal have scored seven and conceded none. Mauricio Pellegrino is expected to stick with in-form striker Charlie Austin despite Shane Long recovering from a calf problem as he looks to improve that record. Arsène Wenger will be without defender Shkodran Mustafi but Theo Walcott, who scored a hat-trick against his former club in January’s FA Cup win, should be available despite a tight calf.

1153	Arsenal	Newcastle United	1	0	16/12/2017	18	Rafael Benítez has tried everything in recent games – different formations, different personnel – and the captain, Jamaal Lascelles, admitted there had been harsh words after Wednesday’s loss to Everton. But Newcastle United have been unable to stop their slump; it is now seven defeats in eight and, unsurprisingly, the nerve ends on Tyneside are raw. A visit to Arsenal does not seem like the best medicine but Arsène Wenger’s side are also jittery. David Hytner	1	-0.9422627091407776,0.0818510353565216
1154	Brighton	Burnley	0	0	16/12/2017	18	Brighton are experiencing their first rocky patch since coming up and after such a good start have begun to look rather like a promoted side – conceding sloppy goals and failing to put chances away. The latter is a particular concern; their only goal in the past five games has come from the penalty spot and Burnley will take some imagination to break down. Sean Dyche and company have set a standard for teams in Albion’s position: at worst Saturday may be a useful learning exercise. Nick Ames	0	-0.9926077425479889,-0.9685736298561096
1155	Chelsea	Southampton	1	0	16/12/2017	18	Antonio Conte expects to “suffer” against Southampton, which was a surprising choice of words before the visit of a team thrashed at home in midweek by Leicester. Yet Chelsea expect their visitors to be stung by that loss, and therefore much improved from the lethargic mishmash which succumbed too easily on the south coast. “The coach, the club, the players don’t want to extend a bad run, and will want to give a response against a team like Chelsea,” said Conte. “Manchester City only beat them recently in the 96th minute.” The champions will be wary.

1156	Leicester City	Crystal Palace	0	3	16/12/2017	18	Leicester City and Crystal Palace are on fine runs of form and the latter would get out of the bottom three, for a day at least, with a draw. A problem Roy Hodgson has to solve though is Palace’s goal tally of zero from eight away games. Leicester, meanwhile, have only failed to score once at home this season against Manchester City. Hodgson should be very wary of baiting Claude Puel’s revitalised Foxes. Graham Searles	-1	-0.9904654920101166,-0.9990180730819702
1157	Manchester City	Tottenham Hotspur	4	1	16/12/2017	18	Manchester City have not beaten Tottenham Hotspur since May 2015, which means Pep Guardiola is yet to defeat Mauricio Pochetinno’s side since taking over. The smart money, though, says Saturday will be the day as City are 18 points better off and flying. If Spurs can worry the home side through pace, though, as Liverpool did in September before Sadio Mané’s sending off, they may have a chance of handing City a first league defeat.

1158	Stoke City	West Ham United	0	3	16/12/2017	18	The league’s most porous defences meet but, as if by magic, West Ham United’s has dramatically improved of late. They have kept two consecutive clean sheets since Joe Hart vanished from the goalmouth. David Moyes will be delighted those blanks took four points from meetings with Chelsea and Arsenal but should also be wary of his side’s confidence growing too rapidly. Stoke City have no such conjuring to call on and fans will fear their record-worst start to a Premier League season rolls on. Could Tony Pulis be on his way back to the Potteries?

1159	Bournemouth	Liverpool	0	4	17/12/2017	18	For Jürgen Klopp, a trip to Bournemouth is a headache his Liverpool side could probably do without. After stuttering to draws at home to Everton and then West Brom, they now face Eddie Howe’s side, who on home turf have a habit of giving the bigger sides a fright – if not worse – as in this fixture last season when Bournemouth came from 3-1 behind to take victory. Klopp could again make changes – Simon Mignolet may return in goal – while Howe, too, has said he will rotate owing to the hectic festive schedule. Ben Fisher	-1	0.326438029607137,-0.8216695189476013
1160	West Brom	Manchester United	1	2	17/12/2017	18	West Brom’s wait for a win has continued under Alan Pardew and will stand at a heady four months if unsuccessful against Manchester United. The vast amount of draws accrued are keeping their heads narrowly above water, just. United have to win to maintain hopes of another league title but the side’s performance may be affected before kick-off should Manchester City beat Tottenham on Saturday.

1161	Everton	Swansea City	3	1	18/12/2017	18	Five games without defeat have elevated Everton’s position and mood under Sam Allardyce and with Yannick Bolasie available for the first time in 12 months, the new manager’s options are improving too. How Paul Clement could do with a similar turnaround. Swansea remain bottom of the table following a lesson by Manchester City, although they are not the only team to suffer that fate this season, and have not won away in the league since August. Their recent home win over West Brom, however, demonstrates there can be no complacency at Goodison Park. Andy Hunter	1	0.9781720042228699,-0.021131902933120728
1162	Brighton	Watford	1	0	23/12/2017	18	Brighton are in need of a win and this could be a perfect opportunity. Watford’s early lustre under Marco Silva has faded; they have lost four of their past five – seven of their past 10, looking further back – and among today’s long list of absentees is the influential Abdoulaye Doucouré. Chris Hughton must make one change himself, with the centre-back Shane Duffy suspended, and the home side will hope to build on last weekend’s good showing against Burnley in their bid to avoid a harsh winter.

1163	Burnley	Tottenham Hotspur	0	3	23/12/2017	18	Burnley could not have imagined when drawing at Wembley in August that they would be higher in the table than Tottenham when the return fixture came around. The visitors will be anxious to put the 4-1 defeat at Manchester City on their last trip to the north west behind them, while the home side will be missing ever-present James Tarkowski for the next three matches, the defender having picked up a retrospective ban for elbowing Glenn Murray at Brighton.

1164	Everton	Chelsea	0	0	23/12/2017	18	The third meeting between the clubs this season sees Antonio Conte facing a third different Everton manager, and a different proposition now that Sam Allardyce is at the helm. Eden Hazard may lead the Chelsea attack with Álvaro Morata suspended after collecting a fifth booking of the campaign in midweek for celebrating his wife’s pregnancy. Everton’s new manager made no apologies for an ultra-defensive display away at Liverpool recently but whether another can be deployed at Goodison Park in a bid to protect his unbeaten start is questionable.

Leicester had to go to extra time against Manchester City and Claude Puel feels they were unlucky to lose on penalties though the culprits, Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, only featured for an hour in total.

1166	Manchester City	Bournemouth	4	0	23/12/2017	18	August’s reverse fixture featured Raheem Sterling’s last-gasp winner, the first of Manchester City’s record run of 16 Premier League wins. Now though it would be a major surprise if Bournemouth were able to escape the Etihad Stadium with a draw. City are so supreme at present that, if Eddie Howe’s side do take all three points they will have produced a shock of giant-killing dimension. Jamie Jackson	1	0.9989158809185028,0.9952396154403687
1167	Stoke City	West Brom	3	1	23/12/2017	18	Mark Hughes may be confident he will still be in charge if Stoke City lose to West Brom but one thinks the last chance saloon could run dry if the Welshman suffers a fourth successive defeat. Alan Pardew desperately needs a win of his own as the Baggies sit second from bottom showing promise but little end product.

1168	Swansea City	Crystal Palace	1	1	23/12/2017	18	Leon Britton takes charge as caretaker player-manager against Crystal Palace but will be able to help struggling Swansea only from the dugout owing to a calf injury. A repeat of last year’s epic 5-4 win seems unlikely as the home side have scored just 10 goals in 18 matches – half as many as this time last season – and face Roy Hodgson’s rebuilt Palace rather than Alan Pardew’s derelict defence.

1169	West Ham United	Newcastle United	2	3	23/12/2017	18	West Ham have climbed out of the bottom three after picking up seven points from their past three games and another win against Newcastle United at the London Stadium will bolster the belief they were right to hire David Moyes. They are without the suspended Manuel Lanzini, however, and the Argentinian’s absence will give Newcastle hope of ending their winless run. Jacob Steinberg	-1	0.9896546602249146,0.9906747937202454
1170	Bournemouth	Everton	2	1	30/12/2017	18	Eddie Howe will hope Bournemouth can build on Callum Wilson’s controversial late equaliser on Boxing Day against Everton, unbeaten since their last trip to the south coast – a harrowing 4-1 defeat at Southampton prior to Sam Allardyce’s appointment as manager. A Bournemouth team with severe injury problems have not tasted victory since November while Everton are looking for a first win in three before facing Manchester United and Liverpool next week.

The Premier League champions are 16 points behind Manchester City and their domestic season is now a sprint towards Champions League qualification. Antonio Conte’s slightly rejigged team are seeking a 10th win in 13 matches and an eighth in succession at home. Momentum must be maintained before next week’s visit to Arsenal.

While all eyes strain for a sight of Liverpool’s statement of intent, however, Jürgen Klopp’s focus will be on breaking a barren run against Claude Puel. The Leicester City manager was unbeaten in four meetings with Liverpool while at Southampton last season and will be seeking defensive improvement after four games without a win.

It means the title is all but over and so the manager’s job is to ensure United finish second. At the moment they are a point ahead of Chelsea so victory over Southampton is essential.

1177	Crystal Palace	Manchester City	0	0	31/12/2017	18	It is hard to predict anything other than Manchester City celebrating a 19th consecutive victory. The runaway leaders have won six of their past seven games at Selhurst Park in all competitions and will confront a depleted Crystal Palace side with Roy Hodgson sure to rest players before Tuesday’s trip to Southampton. Quite why that fixture could not have been moved back a day remains a mystery, but bBe braced for Hodgson’s pragmatism to prompt another round of knee-jerk accusations that the Premier League is becoming increasingly uncompetitive.

1178	West Brom	Arsenal	1	1	31/12/2017	18	West Brom know how to beat Arsenal. Fire as many balls into the box as often as possible from wide areas, set pieces, goal kicks and throw-ins. Why not even punt it in from kick-off? Arsène Wenger’s lamentable defence has no answer for such tactics at present and concede more than two goals on average in the league when they are breached. Fortunately Wenger still has Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez to bail him out of trouble. Graham Searles	0	0.9989515542984009,-0.004618197679519653
1179	Chelsea	Leicester City	0	0	13/01/2018	18	It looks like N’Golo Kanté will not be getting a third successive Premier League winner’s medal this May, but the Frenchman remains vital to the reigning champions Chelsea and very much missed by their predecessors, Leicester. Claude Puel has revitalised the Foxes and in particular Jamie Vardy, who will look to exploit a Chelsea defence feeling the strain of being in four competitions.

1180	Crystal Palace	Burnley	1	0	13/01/2018	18	Roy Hodgson must be wondering what he has done to deserve such rotten luck. Despite transforming Crystal Place’s fortunes since his arrival in September, the former England manager is now confronted with a mounting injury list that has left his squad looking extremely threadbare. Jeffrey Schlupp and Andros Townsend are the latest to miss out, while Burnley counterpart Sean Dyche must make do without top scorer Chris Wood as his side return to London having already beaten Chelsea and drawn with Tottenham in this campaign.

1181	Newcastle United	Swansea City	1	1	13/01/2018	18	Rafael Benítez is still in the dark about his January transfer budget and does not sound tremendously optimistic about the prospect of actually signing any players this month. Throw in mounting uncertainties about Newcastle’s mooted takeover and Benítez looks to have almost as many problems as Swansea’s Carlos Carvalhal before a relegation six-pointer both managers could desperately do with winning. Potentially key sub-plots include Jonjo Shelvey’s performance against the club he left amid talk of dressing room disruption in south Wales. Louise Taylor	0	-0.9974240660667419,-0.8276791572570801
1182	Tottenham Hotspur	Everton	4	0	13/01/2018	18	Defensive stability? Yes. Free-flowing, attacking prowess? No. Sam Allardyce has done what he needed to do and what was expected of him since taking charge at Everton but even he says his team have not been good enough in the final third. The manager hopes the £27m signing of Cenk Tosun can help – the striker scored against Tottenham for his previous club, Besiktas, in the Europa League in 2014. Tottenham, by contrast, are in form and scoring goals. David Hytner	1	0.9717177351315817,-0.9991217255592346
1183	Watford	Southampton	2	2	13/01/2018	18	Two points from six games sees Southampton sit bottom of the Premier League form table but Watford are only one point and one place ahead of them. Marco Silva, who spoke to the Saints before taking the Watford job in May, has a little more credit in the bank but another defeat for Mauricio Pellegrino could see him gone by the time the sides meet again in the FA Cup in two weeks’ time. Paul Chronnell	0	0,-0.9938687384128571
1184	West Brom	Brighton	2	0	13/01/2018	18	West Brom finally ended their marathon run without a win in all competitions last time out but that was against League Two’s Exeter. Alan Pardew has an ideal chance to build on that against Brighton and to spark a revival as Chris Hughton’s side have scored just five goals on the road this season. Hughton will likely want to stifle West Brom as a result to maintain his side’s course for safety. Graham Searles	1	-0.9725102186203003,0.9992378950119019
1185	Bournemouth	Arsenal	2	1	14/01/2018	18	How Arsène Wenger, who will again be peering from the stands, would love a victory after the nightmare in Nottingham. Arsenal are winless in four in all competitions – their longest barren run since a streak of five starting in February 2016 – and that could easily continue. Eddie Howe can count on making chances with ease against Wenger’s notional defence and that could be enough as the burden of Arsenal’s successes may no longer be able to lie squarely on Alexis Sánchez’s shoulders. The dream of an easier life in Manchester may prove too much of a distraction even if he does play. Graham Searles	1	0,-0.17812001705169678
1186	Liverpool	Manchester City	4	3	14/01/2018	18	Jürgen Klopp starts life without Philippe Coutinho with a request that Anfield forgets the departed Brazilian and concentrates on avenging September’s 5-0 defeat at the Etihad Stadium instead. A key date in the season for both clubs, he says. “City used the momentum and we suffered,” the Liverpool manager said. “We should try to draw a different picture.” Klopp’s side have the form to threaten the league leader’s unbeaten start to the season, having not lost themselves in 13 league games, and City have not won at Anfield since May 2003. The Premier League expects a treat. Andy Hunter	1	-0.33156371116638184,-0.7676506042480469
1187	Manchester United	Stoke City	3	0	15/01/2018	18	José Mourinho, fresh from Manchester United’s break in Dubai, was in relaxed form before Stoke City’s visit. Yet by Monday night his team could be a gaping 18 points behind Manchester City should Pep Guardiola’s side defeat Liverpool. If so, the rest of the season could start to feel particularly embarrassing for Mourinho and his club should City continue to stretch their lead. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.0002765357494354248,0
1188	Arsenal	Crystal Palace	4	1	20/01/2018	18	Arsène Wenger has described the current January window as the most disturbing and destabilising he has known and the noises around a clutch of transfer and contractual situations remain loud. Arsenal must block them out against Roy Hodgson’s resurgent Crystal Palace. What was most disturbing for Wenger’s team in last Sunday’s defeat at Bournemouth was the sterile possession and lack of creativity. Palace will look to be compact. Arsenal must find the answers.

1189	Burnley	Manchester United	0	1	20/01/2018	18	While the Alexis Sánchez saga continues, Manchester United must put that to one side as they travel to Turf Moor hoping to continue their seven game unbeaten run in the league. The reverse fixture on Boxing Day saw Sean Dyche’s side take a two goal lead at Old Trafford, before Jesse Lingard salvaged a point for United with two goals. Lingard’s heroics have become a recurring theme for José Mourinho’s team, but Burnley have not won at home since early December so the England international may not be leaned on quite as heavily. Reuben Pinder	-1	-0.9655052423477173,0.9870903193950653
1190	Everton	West Brom	1	1	20/01/2018	18	Boosted by their January recruits, Everton will see this match as an opportunity to turn a poor run of form around. Theo Walcott will add some much needed pace and will oppose his former team-mate Kieran Gibbs. West Brom picked up three crucial points against fellow strugglers Brighton last time out and must go into this game with the same positive approach. A win could move Alan Pardew’s side to 17th, should Southampton lose to Tottenham at St Mary’s. Reuben Pinder	0	-0.8797833919525146,0.9950677553812662
1191	Leicester City	Watford	2	0	20/01/2018	18	Claude Puel says it will be “the beginning of the end” if Leicester start thinking of trying to qualify for the Europa League, although their supporters could be forgiven for wondering if that is a possibility, especially if the team can maintain the sort of form they showed against Chelsea last Saturday. Watford, on the face of it, should be obliging opponents for Leicester. Marco Silva’s side have been in freefall, with their only victory in their past 10 Premier League games coming against Leicester on Boxing Day. Stuart James	1	0.17877867817878723,-0.501344621181488
1192	Manchester City	Newcastle United	3	1	20/01/2018	18	Three weeks after a sole Raheem Sterling strike won the reverse fixture Pep Guardiola’s side welcome Newcastle United. As Manchester United are at Burnley for a 3pm start a win would cut the gap to nine points and maybe – just maybe – apply some kind of pressure on Manchester City. Yet given how relentless the leaders are there will, surely, be only one winner. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.9859185814857483,0
1193	West Ham United	Bournemouth	1	1	20/01/2018	18	While both sides remain in a relegation battle, the winner of this game could be in ninth place at the end of the weekend. Such are the fine margins in the Premier League’s crammed lower reaches. West Ham are on an upward trajectory after thrashing Huddersfield Town and will be confident of gaining revenge for Callum Wilson’s controversial equaliser in their 3-3 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day. Yet the visitors are only a point behind David Moyes’s side after their battling win over Arsenal. It could be a nervy afternoon. Jacob Steinberg	0	0.9993317723274231,-0.1941789984703064
1194	Southampton	Tottenham Hotspur	1	1	21/01/2018	18	There is little reason for optimism among Southampton fans before this fixture. Tottenham are unbeaten in five while Southampton’s winless league run stretches to 10 games – including a 5-2 Boxing Day thrashing by Spurs. The home side’s only win over Spurs since returning to the Premier League came in May 2016, and was also their last league win over a side in the current top six. Mauricio Pellegrino’s focus now is on the bottom six – Southampton play the other five teams presently in that bracket in the next seven games, so anything gained on Sunday will be a bonus. Niall McVeigh	0	-0.9965312778949738,0.9684016108512878
1195	Swansea City	Liverpool	1	0	22/01/2018	18	Carlos Carvalhal strayed into “David and Goliath” territory when he was talking about this fixture, which provides a measure of what he feels Swansea are up against. Liverpool put five past them on Boxing Day, two days before Carvalhal was appointed, and their 4-3 victory over Manchester City last weekend provided more evidence of their devastating attacking ability. Mohamed Salah has recovered from illness in time to face Swansea and Virgil van Dijk is also available again. Renato Sanches is back in contention for Swansea. Stuart James	1	0.8714308142662048,0.9806791543960571
1196	Arsenal	Everton	5	1	03/02/2018	18	It will certainly be strange to see Theo Walcott in an Everton shirt at the Emirates but plenty has changed for Arsenal after a frenetic January. The hope is the shake-up can re-energise the club. One thing Arsène Wenger wants to maintain is his side’s impressive home form. He is vexed by the wild contrast to their away results. Walcott may fancy vexing him some more after helping Everton to end a wretched run on Wednesday with two goals in the win over Leicester City. David Hytner	1	0.9989356398582458,-0.8609253466129303
1197	Bournemouth	Stoke City	2	1	03/02/2018	18	A brilliant victory at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday pushed Bournemouth into the top half of the Premier League but results at home will be crucial for them guaranteeing their top-flight status. Eddie Howe’s side face Stoke City, who could hand new recruit, the Senegalese midfielder Badou Ndiaye, his debut. Bournemouth have lost just once since Christmas but Howe is not one to get carried away. ”You have to put yourself in the now and my job today is to take the focus onto another tough game.” Ben Fisher	1	0.9937262733777364,0.9979569911956787
1198	Brighton	West Ham United	3	1	03/02/2018	18	Brighton have only claimed victory three times at home this season and their position is beginning to look complicated. The visit of West Ham, blighted by injury and off-field problems, looks like a good opportunity to end their six-match winless run. Record signing Jürgen Locadia is not ready for involvement just yet, although he has begun training, but Leonardo Ulloa should get some minutes on returning to his old home. Brighton are approaching the stage where they need a hero, and perhaps the Argentinian will be that man. Nick Ames	1	-0.25913387537002563,0.9981142282485962
1199	Burnley	Manchester City	1	1	03/02/2018	18	Burnley are still seventh in the table and best of the rest even if Sean Dyche’s side have now gone eight league matches without a win and will be hard pushed to buck that trend against Manchester City – who beat them 4-1 in the FA Cup last month. The runaway leaders can expect a tough game but should have more than enough attacking invention to prevail despite not signing Riyad Mahrez. Paul Wilson	0	0.7391679883003235,-0.9173004627227783
1200	Leicester City	Swansea City	1	1	03/02/2018	18	A match that threatens to be overshadowed by the absence of Riyad Mahrez, who has not reported for training at Leicester since he missed out on a move to Manchester City and will play no part here. How unsettling that whole episode has been for Leicester, who are unbeaten at home since mid-December, remains to be seen. Swansea are unlikely to be able to call on new-signing Andre Ayew, who is a major doubt, but Carlos Carvalhal’s side will travel with confidence after back-to-back wins over Liverpool and Arsenal.

1201	West Brom	Southampton	2	3	03/02/2018	18	West Brom will start on the back foot after the club revealed they are investigating four senior players over an incident at their warm-weather training camp in Spain. However Southampton’s victory earlier in February at the Hawthorns could serve as excellent motivation. Revenge would be sweet and Alan Pardew will be focused on earning a quarter-final spot that could spark his side into life for a tilt at Premier League survival.

1202	Crystal Palace	Newcastle United	1	1	04/02/2018	18	Neither Rafael Benítez or Roy Hodgson will be satisfied with their business in the transfer window, though the possibility of Islam Slimani playing some part at Selhurst Park may cheer the Spaniard. Hodgson has now lost Bakary Sako to a broken ankle, a sixth long-term absentee, until into next season and may have to turn sooner than he would have liked to his three young new signings. A year ago, Sunderland came to south London and won 4-0. Newcastle will hope to repeat that trick. Dominic Fifield	0	-0.3396194974581401,0.9977158308029175
1203	Liverpool	Tottenham Hotspur	2	2	04/02/2018	18	Tottenham will arrive on a high following defeat of Manchester United plus a comprehensive victory over Liverpool at Wembley in October. Since that 4-1 reverse, however, Jürgen Klopp’s side have lost only once in 16 league games, scoring 43 goals in that period, and arrested a recent dip with victory at Huddersfield. Only two points separate the teams in the race for Champions League qualification and it would be a significant step towards that goal for Liverpool should they repeat the heights of their last home league display against Manchester City.

1204	Watford	Chelsea	4	1	05/02/2018	18	Things looked so good for both these clubs last May. Antonio Conte was basking in leading Chelsea to the title in his first season while Watford secured the services of Marco Silva ahead of a host of other suitors. Wind the clock forward nine months, however, and things have unravelled both in west London and Hertfordshire, with Silva gone and replaced last month by Javi Gracia and Conte seemingly talking his way to the exit door at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea do, however, remain in the top four but Spurs are breathing down their necks and Conte’s side could use a return to winning ways on Monday after the disastrous defeat to Bournemouth.

1205	Everton	Crystal Palace	3	1	10/02/2018	18	Apologies are required all round from Everton as they attempt to put breathing space between themselves and Roy Hodgson’s injury-hit team. Sam Allardyce owes one to Hodgson having not contacted his England predecessor personally in the 17 months since being caught mocking his speech. Everton’s players also need to atone for their apology of a performance, and latest in a series of capitulations, at Arsenal last weekend. Palace are missing nine senior players through injury and Goodison Park will be short on forgiveness should Everton fail to capitalise on their good fortune.

1206	Manchester City	Leicester City	5	1	10/02/2018	18	Pep Guardiola stated pleasure at the display in last Saturday’s draw at Burnley yet a born-winner will want Manchester City to return to victorious ways especially as the Champions League resumes next week. How things have changed for Leicester City and Riyad Mahrez since the latter tore City apart in the same fixture two years ago during the Foxes’ title-winning season. The Algerian is available again but unlikely to start after only returning to training on Friday due to his disgruntlement over a failed move to the league leaders.

1207	Stoke City	Brighton	1	1	10/02/2018	18	Last week’s defeat at Bournemouth burst the bubble of optimism since Paul Lambert’s arrival and also saw Stoke drop back into the bottom three. Brighton are five places above them but only three points ahead and Chris Hughton’s side are one of those Lambert will be hoping to reel in over the final 12 games. Saturday would be a good place to start. Paul Chronnell	0	0.9962936043739319,0.9987872242927551
1208	Swansea City	Burnley	1	0	10/02/2018	18	Swansea’s revival under Carlos Carvalhal has been hugely impressive and seen them glean 11 points from six matches but Burnley will pose a different kind of test to their last three home fixtures in the league, which were against Spurs, Liverpool and Arsenal. Sean Dyche’s side have not won in a Premier League game since December but they remain awkward opponents – only the two Manchester clubs have conceded fewer goals this season. Carvalhal could give debuts to André Ayew and Andy King, while Stephen Ward is fit again for Burnley. Stuart James	1	0.9980777502059937,0.006513446569442749
1209	Tottenham Hotspur	Arsenal	1	0	10/02/2018	18	Harry Kane vs Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is at the top of the bill but this is a fascinating clash on so many levels and it has the trappings of a six-pointer in terms of the race for a top-four finish. Tottenham have come to feel at home at Wembley but Arsenal have won on each of their previous nine visits to the national stadium.

1210	West Ham United	Watford	2	0	10/02/2018	18	Watford will be full of confidence after walloping Chelsea on Monday night. Javi Gracia is settling in nicely after replacing Marco Silva and Watford visit a West Ham side who are three points above the bottom three after last weekend’s defeat at Brighton. David Moyes desperately needs his players to show some fight. At least the arrival of Patrice Evra on a free transfer might help in that regard.

1211	Huddersfield	Bournemouth	4	1	11/02/2018	18	Huddersfield’s victory at Birmingham City in the FA Cup replay in midweek has given rise to hope that the result will stimulate a confidence boost that could yield their first league victory since before Christmas. They must also find more creativity. Having slid down the table they are nearing the time when every match will be described as a must-win. But Bournemouth, who seemed to be in similar straits until winning two on the trot, have shown how quickly moods can improve, thus representing inspiration, as well as a threat, for David Wagner’s men.	1	0,0
1212	Newcastle United	Manchester United	1	0	11/02/2018	18	A thigh strain permitting, Islam Slimani hopes to makes his Newcastle debut. Can the Algeria striker and Leicester loanee help Rafael Benítez put an old foe, José Mourinho, in his place? Might Slimani be capable of scoring the goals needed to ensure Benitez’s team avoid relegation? Will Mourinho win a Premier League game at St James’ Park for the first time? Can Mo Diamé continue to impress in central midfield for the Tynesiders? Is it really a little over two decades since Newcastle and Manchester United were vying for the Premier League title?

1213	Southampton	Liverpool	0	2	11/02/2018	18	Liverpool head to the south coast with Jürgen Klopp joking that perhaps they should move their scouting department into the area in reference to the number of players they have signed from Saints recently. Virgil van Dijk became the sixth and last of them in January, and the £75m Dutchman is assured of a rough reception from the home crowd for the manner of his departure, while Adam Lallana, sent off in midweek for the under-23s, may find a place on the bench. Southampton won last week, a six-pointer at West Brom, and are likely to be unchanged with Mauricio Pellegrino, a former Liverpool defender himself, conscious of the need to back that up with another three points as five of their next six league games are away from home.

1214	Chelsea	West Brom	3	0	12/02/2018	18	The visit of a club four points adrift at the foot would normally cheer the champions, though West Brom pose a particular threat to those in charge at Chelsea. They are not the team to confront when the head coach’s job is on the line, as André Villas-Boas and Roberto Di Matteo might attest. Antonio Conte has seen his side beaten by three goal margins in their last two fixtures, with a top four finish under threat. Alan Pardew’s visitors have a more appealing run of games after Monday, but their own comeback must start somewhere. Why not Stamford Bridge? Dominic Fifield	1	-0.3615896701812744,0.15305182337760925
1215	Bournemouth	Newcastle United	2	2	24/02/2018	18	Bournemouth welcome Rafael Benítez’s Newcastle United to the south coast on the back of a warm-weather training camp in Portugal. Both teams ought to be revitalised after a two-week break and need to hit the ground running on their return to action, with the visitors, in particular, still looking over the shoulder. Jermain Defoe could make his comeback from an ankle injury, most likely from the bench, for the hosts. ”He’s trained and I’m pleased with what we’ve seen, he’s a natural goalscorer,” Eddie Howe said.

1216	Brighton	Swansea City	4	1	24/02/2018	18	Brighton and Swansea are both enjoying a spell of good form and are unbeaten in five and 10 matches respectively in all competitions. Chris Hughton will hope Jürgen Locadia can pick up from where he left off against Coventry and provide the attacking threat his side have lacked at times this season. A win could bump Brighton further from the relegation but the same goes for Swansea. Carlos Carvalhal has completely transformed his side and it would not be surprising if the honeymoon continued at the Amex Stadium. Graham Searles	1	0.9679942727088928,0
1217	Burnley	Southampton	1	1	24/02/2018	18	Burnley were the undoubted success story of the first half of the season, accumulating 32 points from their first 19 games. Since Christmas a brake has been applied, with four draws and four defeats. While survival is unlikely to be an issue for Sean Dyche’s side it is already a worry for Southampton, who come to Turf Moor in the bottom three and in desperate need of points.

1218	Leicester City	Stoke City	1	1	24/02/2018	18	Leicester have lost some momentum in the league following a disappointing run that has been overshadowed by Riyad Mahrez’s antics. Mahrez, however, is set to make his first league start for more than a month here. Stoke, who will be without the injured Peter Crouch, are second from bottom and have not won away for four months. Paul Lambert has vowed to go to Leicester to attack and the Stoke manager has also said he is considering handing a Premier League debut to 18-year-old Tyrese Campbell.

1219	Liverpool	West Ham United	4	1	24/02/2018	18	David Moyes has never won in 14 visits to Anfield as manager, losing seven and drawing seven, and his prospects of guiding West Ham to back-to-back league victories for the first time since December 2016 appear slim given the sensational form of Liverpool’s forwards, fresh from a warm-weather training trip to Marbella. Mohamed Salah has scored 17 goals in his last 16 league appearances and in each of Liverpool’s past five games. Daniel Sturridge was the last Liverpool forward to score in six successive outings back in February 2014. Roberto Firmino is enjoying his most prolific season in English football and Sadio Mané’s last outing brought a hat-trick against Porto. Reasons to be fearful for West Ham.

Javi Gracia will be keen to capitalise on their poor away form and record his second win as manager. If Abdoulaye Doucouré can dominate midfield, as he always does when Watford have been at their best, then three important points are achievable.

1221	Crystal Palace	Tottenham Hotspur	0	1	25/02/2018	18	Crystal Palace could find themselves back in the bottom three at kick-off on Sunday with the side’s resources now severely hampered by injuries to 12 senior players, so the last thing Roy Hodgson needed was a visit from Tottenham Hotspur. Mauricio Pochettino will sense this as an opportunity to take advantage of Manchester United and Chelsea’s match above them, and Arsenal’s distraction in the League Cup final. His team have won their past five meetings with Palace. The hosts will have to perform out of their skins if that record is to end. Dominic Fifield	-1	-0.32903385162353516,0.9978633522987366
1222	Manchester United	Chelsea	2	1	25/02/2018	18	José Mourinho has guided Manchester United to only one win against a direct rival this season – the 3-1 victory at Arsenal in early December. On Sunday this has to change against a Chelsea team only three points behind his side. United fans will hope their manager instructs his men to take the contest to Antonio Conte’s but whether this occurs remains to be seen as Mourinho’s default position can often be safety-first.

1223	Burnley	Everton	2	1	03/03/2018	18	Burnley were the victors at Goodison in October toward the end of Ronald Koeman’s reign, and Sean Dyche’s side remain above Everton in the table despite not winning so far this year. With only one set of three points away from home all season, at Newcastle, Everton under Sam Allardyce are not in great shape either and both sides might settle for a draw.

1224	Leicester City	Bournemouth	1	1	03/03/2018	18	It is a measure of how tight things are in the mid-to-lower reaches of the Premier League that Bournemouth, who are still not clear of relegation trouble, will move to within a point of eighth-placed Leicester if they win at the King Power Stadium. Leicester have had a little wobble of late, picking up only two points from a possible 12, but Claude Puel’s side should be boosted by the return of Shinji Okazaki, who is available again after being sidelined with a knee injury.

1225	Liverpool	Newcastle United	2	0	03/03/2018	18	Rafael Benítez has never lost in five meetings against Liverpool as the manager of Valencia, Chelsea and Newcastle but it will require something special to preserve that record. Liverpool have scored more goals and won more home games against Newcastle than any other team in the Premier League era – 89 and 17 respectively – and, in Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah, have two forwards in outstanding form. Salah is bidding to score in a seventh successive game, a feat last achieved at Liverpool by Daniel Sturridge in 2014, while Firmino has 15 in his last 18 starts. Andy Hunter	1	0.986195981502533,0
1226	Southampton	Stoke City	0	0	03/03/2018	18	This fixture does not normally have much riding on it come March but this season Southampton and Stoke are sliding into relegation trouble. Paul Lambert has tightened up a porous defence and Saints have a bad habit of letting victories slip away – they have won five and drawn a league-high 12 games this season. Steven Davis and Shane Long face late fitness tests for Southampton, while Ryan Shawcross and Peter Crouch are available for Stoke. Niall McVeigh	0	-0.9811872839927673,0
1227	Swansea City	West Ham United	4	1	03/03/2018	18	A game that feels like must-win for Swansea and must-not-lose for West Ham. Carlos Carvalhal’s side will move out of the relegation zone and level on points with David Moyes’s team if they can rack up a seventh successive home victory in all competitions. Andre Ayew looks set to make his first start for Swansea since re-signing from West Ham in January and what chance the Ghanaian marks the occasion with a goal? Javier Hernández could return to the West Ham starting lineup after coming off the bench against Liverpool. Stuart James	1	0.9595860689878464,0
1228	Watford	West Brom	1	0	03/03/2018	18	West Brom are frozen at the bottom of the table after a run of four successive league defeats and victory at Watford is imperative to avoid their plight deepening further. Gerard Deulofeu’s broken foot provides some hope as the Spaniard had hit the ground running and provided relief from Javi Gracia’s long injury list. However Gracia should not be too concerned as West Brom are terrible away from home – winning once in 14 attempts this season. Graham Searles	1	0.9952247440814972,-0.9902781844139099
1229	Brighton	Arsenal	2	1	04/03/2018	18	Arsène Wenger has been well and truly humbled after back-to-back thrashings at the hands of Manchester City. Arsenal now, if they didn’t quite before, look completely broken and Brighton will be rubbing their hands with glee, not just for warmth, at the very realistic prospect of an important win in terms of their survival. Glenn Murray has four goals in his past five appearances in all competitions and should be able to brush off Arsenal’s atypical defence with ease if given the chance. Graham Searles	1	0,0.9992420474688212
1230	Crystal Palace	Manchester United	2	3	05/03/2018	18	Crystal Palace have not beaten Manchester United in the top flight since confirming a third place finish 27 years ago and are expecting to be back in the bottom three at kick-off as Roy Hodgson sifts through his ranks of walking wounded to construct a team. United have lost their past two away games in the league but will attempt to capitalise on the encouraging home win against Chelsea. Paul Pogba scored here last season. Maybe the venue will spark an upturn in his fortunes.. Dominic Fifield	-1	0,0
1231	Chelsea	Crystal Palace	2	1	10/03/2018	18	The ailing champions have long been spying this match as potential relief in amid games with Barcelona and the two Manchester clubs, but they have lost to Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge in each of the last two seasons. This match may come too soon for Wilfried Zaha to start for Palace but he has been the scourge of Chelsea in recent times. The hosts, with four defeats in their past five league games and Wednesday’s trip to Camp Nou looming large, will hope to have the job done before Zaha can be summoned from the bench.

1232	Everton	Brighton	2	0	10/03/2018	18	Sam Allardyce struck a more conciliatory tone before a game he described as arguably the biggest of his brief Everton reign, conscious that bridge-building is needed with supporters who made their feelings clear towards him at Burnley. Goodison Park may well be hostile – “We are absolutely aware of that,” Allardyce said – but there is also need for unity, however temporary, with Stoke away, Manchester City and Liverpool on the horizon. Brighton have the capacity to increase Allardyce’s problems. Chris Hughton’s side are unbeaten in seven games and are above their big-spending opponents in the table.

1233	West Brom	Leicester City	1	4	10/03/2018	18	West Brom’s time in the Premier League appears to be running out with Alan Pardew’s side eight points from safety with nine games to play. A run of five successive defeats speaks for itself but they have performed miracles to stay in the league before. Leicester, though, will be confident they can easily add another to that tally, with the superior attacking qualities of Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy, while snapping their winless run of five matches.

1234	West Ham United	Burnley	0	3	10/03/2018	18	It had gone a little unnoticed that before the win over Everton last Saturday Burnley had gone 11 Premier League games and almost three months without a win. If Sean Dyche’s side can also triumph at West Ham on Saturday they can move to within two points of sixth-placed Arsenal. Joe Hart, meanwhile, has been thrown a World Cup lifeline by David Moyes. The goalkeeper’s England spot for this summer’s tournament in Russia has been in jeopardy since he lost his place at West Ham in December following some inconsistent performances. But Moyes said: “Joe Hart will start.” Paul Chronnell	-1	-0.0004419088363647461,0.32318975528081256
1235	Arsenal	Watford	3	0	11/03/2018	18	Arsenal showed ‘cojones’ in the Europa League win at Milan on Thursday – something the Watford captain, Troy Deeney, accused them of lacking at Vicarage Road in October. Arsène Wenger’s players might want to prove a point to him but, really, the oomph has been knocked from their Premier League season. It is now the Europa League or bust. Watford have won three out of their past four matches. As ever, the mood at the Emirates will be a sub-plot. David Hytner	1	-0.9414270122845968,0.4942687551180522
1236	Bournemouth	Tottenham Hotspur	1	4	11/03/2018	18	Bournemouth become the first team to take on a wounded Tottenham who are nevertheless undefeated in 11 league games and desperate to take another step towards qualifying for the Champions League for the third season in a row. “The competition doesn’t wait for you,” said the manager, Mauricio Pochettino, reflecting on their calamitous midweek loss to Juventus. “If you’re happy or sad, the team has to move on and think about the weekend.” Bournemouth have been doing little else since their draw at Leicester last time out, with Jermain Defoe, scorer of 91 league goals for Spurs, likely to be on the bench again. “Since Christmas we have been very strong and have beaten some big teams here,” said the manager Eddie Howe, who would probably be delighted with a point this time.

1237	Stoke City	Manchester City	0	2	12/03/2018	18	Stoke, under Mark Hughes, were humiliated 7-2 by Manchester City back in October with six different Citizens finding the net. However while Pep Guardiola’s side are the heavy favourites to win again – a repeated destruction is unlikely. Paul Lambert has brought back Stoke’s once-lauded defensive stability. They have conceded four in six games with the Scot in charge compared to 50 in the 23 preceding games this season, which provides hope in more important fixtures to come.

1238	Bournemouth	West Brom	2	1	17/03/2018	18	West Brom’s time in the Premier League appears to be reaching an inevitable conclusion after another defeat, against Leicester, last week. A seventh in succession feels likely for Alan Pardew’s side, despite Gareth Barry and Jonny Evans returning, and a win for Bournemouth would give them one of the three required to confirm a fourth season in the top flight. Is there a risk of complacency for Bournemouth? “Absolutely no chance,” said Eddie Howe. Graham Searles	1	-0.9970613121986389,-0.9989827275276184
1239	Liverpool	Watford	5	0	17/03/2018	18	Liverpool will be eager to return to winning ways against Watford and open up a seven-point gap over Chelsea in fifth place. Jürgen Klopp’s side were undone by mistakes at Old Trafford last week and the manager could make changes as he searches for a more sturdy defensive combination that could help guide Liverpool past Manchester City in the Champions League quarter-finals in April. Graham Searles	1	-0.03955814242362976,0.9978845715522766
1240	Stoke City	Everton	1	2	17/03/2018	18	Sam Allardyce takes Everton to struggling Stoke, whom they beat 1-0 on the opening day with a debut goal from Wayne Rooney when both teams were under different management, with five successive defeats on their recent travels, his last point coming when the team were outplayed in a 0-0 by West Brom. “We’ve been using some more work into the mind in the analysis room. Who we are, what we want to achieve, what we can get,” Allardyce said. Stoke, who lost their free-hit to Manchester City 2-0 on Monday, see this as a match they can and must get three points from and with games running out, will be confident they have the wherewithal to further bamboozle Everton. Mark Tallentire	-1	0.9988052845001221,0.9974937736988068
1241	Brighton	Leicester City	0	2	31/03/2018	18	Both sides can, to all intents and purposes, just go out and play although Leicester could conceivably wonder whether a kind-looking run of games can heave them into faint contention for sixth place. Chris Hughton does not quite see Brighton’s position that way and hopes their next two games against Huddersfield and Crystal Palace banish any lingering relegation concerns. The omens look good: they have won their past four home matches in all competitions and pack a far greater punch in attack than earlier in the season.

1242	Crystal Palace	Liverpool	1	2	31/03/2018	18	Liverpool can move 10 points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea with a win at Selhurst Park, but will be wary that the ailing champions have two games in hand and are still to host them this season. That should spur Jürgen Klopp’s side on, even with this a nuisance of a game before the more anticipated contests against Manchester City and Everton to come. Palace, with their ranks of wounded still too numerous for comfort, will hope Christian Benteke and Mamadou Sakho have points to prove against their former club.

1243	Everton	Manchester City	1	3	31/03/2018	18	Everton are the only current Premier League team Pep Guardiola has not beaten as the Manchester City manager and there cannot be greater incentive to complete the set than the prize on the horizon that would follow a victory at Goodison Park. Three points will offer City the priceless opportunity of winning the Premier League title at home to Manchester United next weekend. It is an opportunity not to be wasted, although Wednesday’s Champions League quarter-final at Liverpool may influence Guardiola’s selection. Sam Allardyce’s side are unbeaten at home since New Year’s Day. Andy Hunter	-1	0.030941307544708252,0.9987422227859497
1244	Manchester United	Swansea City	2	0	31/03/2018	18	Manchester United’s race – for second place and respectability – resumes with the visit of Swansea managed by Carlos Carvalhal, who has inspired his side to build a three-point gap above the relegation zone. Next up for United is Manchester City when Pep Guardiola’s side could claim the title at the Etihad. To have any chance of avoiding that prospect Swansea must be beaten, so José Mourinho will not be short of motivation. Jamie Jackson	1	0.9938525557518005,0.9205461144447327
1245	Watford	Bournemouth	2	2	31/03/2018	18	Watford may have just about recovered from being ripped apart by Mohamed Salah before the international break. Javi Gracia will demand a response against Bournemouth, after conceding eight and failing to score in their past two matches on the road, but equally should have confidence in his side’s ability to bounce back based on their strong home record this season. Richarlison’s lack of form is a concern though. The Brazilian scored his first goal for Watford against Eddie Howe’s side in August but has failed to find the net since November.

1246	West Brom	Burnley	1	2	31/03/2018	18	Burnley are one of only three sides to lose to West Brom in the league this season, a 1-0 win in August giving the visitors an improbable six points from six at that stage. Much has changed since and Burnley have a club-record 43 Premier League points while West Brom are 10 adrift of safety and all but relegated. “I kind of feel I owe this club,” said Alan Pardew, who has only one league win to his name since arriving at the Hawthorns in late November. “The results since I’ve been here should have been better and I’d like to come back next season with a squad that better reflects the way I play, with a bit more attacking prowess.” Burnley have won their last two games – Everton and West Ham – and with only 14 away goals conceded will be disappointed if they do not make it three in a row.

1247	West Ham United	Southampton	3	0	31/03/2018	18	West Ham will be praying there is no repeat of the scenes that marred their 3-0 defeat against Burnley at the London Stadium three weeks ago. They have not played since then and extra security measures will be in place for the visit of Southampton, who will push 17th-placed West Ham into the bottom three if they win. Mark Hughes has said he wants to use the crowd against the home team. Jacob Steinberg	1	-0.9971717000007629,-0.9694508910179138
1248	Bournemouth	Crystal Palace	2	2	07/04/2018	18	Crystal Palace need to move on from their unlucky defeat against Liverpool last time out despite the mental struggle of winning only once in their past nine matches. Roy Hodgson’s side may have received a blessing in disguise though through Christian Benteke’s lack of fitness. The Belgian striker has scored only two goals this season. Someone else having a chance to be the focal point of Palace’s attack could be the difference between survival and relegation. Bournemouth look safe but Eddie Howe remains focused on not letting up until his side’s Premier League status is confirmed. Graham Searles	0	0.9712252020835876,-0.9914953708648682
1249	Everton	Liverpool	0	0	07/04/2018	18	Sam Allardyce has blamed a small minority on Twitter and Instagram for the negative reaction towards his reign as Everton manager but dissent may be widespread and within ear-shot at Goodison Park should his team repeat their feeble effort against Manchester City in the 231st Merseyside derby. Everton are enduring the worst run in their history against Liverpool – 16 derbies without a win – and while confidence and form is soaring on the other side of Stanley Park Jürgen Klopp must ring the changes before next week’s Champions League rematch at the Etihad Stadium. Andy Hunter	0	-0.8775849938392639,0
1250	Leicester City	Newcastle United	1	2	07/04/2018	18	Newcastle will arrive in confident mood after climbing to 12th in the table on the back of a fine run of form that has seen them lose only twice in the league since the turn of the year. With 35 points on the board, another victory would all but secure their Premier League status. Leicester remain hopeful of finishing the season in seventh, although Claude Puel will have to rejig his midfield after losing Matty James to injury and Wilfred Ndidi to suspension.

1251	Manchester City	Manchester United	2	3	07/04/2018	18	The timing of the 176th derby could not be better as Manchester City have a priceless chance to claim a fifth league title against their fiercest rivals at home. If City pull this off then their players will become legends and those in the Manchester United side will be constantly reminded of their unwanted part in Mancunian history. It should be some match at the Etihad Stadium. Jamie Jackson	-1	0.3280566930770874,0
1252	Stoke City	Tottenham Hotspur	1	2	07/04/2018	18	Stoke have six matches in which to save themselves from relegation and the portents are inauspicious. Paul Lambert has had a host of problems to address before the visit of Tottenham, including Saido Berahino’s time-keeping, Ibrahim Afellay’s attitude and an interview in which Xherdan Shaqiri was quoted bemoaning the lack of quality at Stoke. That is hardly the ideal preparation for Spurs, who have beaten Stoke by four goals in their past four meetings. Lambert has introduced a little more solidity since replacing Mark Hughes but they still do not look capable of a clean sheet. Paul Doyle	-1	-0.9976879159609476,-0.9997273087501526
1253	Watford	Burnley	1	2	07/04/2018	18	Burnley are flying in seventh and catching sixth-placed Arsenal, who are more focused on Europa League activities, is still a realistic proposition. Ashley Barnes’ contribution of four goals in four has been a huge part of their recent success and that could well continue because Watford have conceded 10 goals in their past three matches. Javi Gracia will be looking for his side to build on their improved showing last week against Bournemouth with a win that would equal their points tally last season.

1254	West Brom	Swansea City	1	1	07/04/2018	18	Swansea will be feeling much better about visiting the Hawthorns than their trip to Old Trafford last week. Carlos Carvalhal’s mission to save the club can get back on track against West Brom who are now 11 points adrift with six games to play. However who knows what change Alan Pardew’s exit could bring. The relief for the players of a manager’s tactics that were failing absolutely could be enough to inspire an unlikely victory despite survival hopes approaching the academic stage.

Helpfully their 4-1 demolition of CSKA Moscow on Thursday also makes the trip to Russia next week much more appealing than it might have been. Arsène Wenger’s side should be in relaxed mood and able to fire on all cylinders. Southampton’s chances of securing a much-needed win look bleak after failing to score in their past three league matches. Graham Searles	1	0.9895586768786112,-0.9997389912605286
1256	Chelsea	West Ham United	1	1	08/04/2018	18	Stamford Bridge will bid an emotional farewell to Ray Wilkins before a derby which will test both teams’ resolve. Chelsea suffered a fourth home defeat of the campaign last weekend, rendering their pursuit of the top four forlorn, and they may have surrendered their title by kick-off. These are difficult times for Antonio Conte. West Ham were buoyed by that restorative thrashing of Southampton, but are hardly clear of the relegation scrap just yet as they pursue a first win across the capital since September 2002.

1257	Burnley	Leicester City	2	1	14/04/2018	18	Sean Dyche was briefly linked with the Leicester job when it became vacant early in the season, mainly because of his Midlands connections, and Saturday’s visitors to Turf Moor might consider that a chance missed now that Burnley are likely to end up in Europe.

This team’s greatest shortcoming this season has been up front where analysis by Gracenote Sports, taking into account the quality and frequency of chances created, suggests they should have plundered 52 goals, rather than their measly 33. Benteke’s projected goal tally was 12. He has two. Brighton, relatively solid all season, will seek to blunt their bitter rivals and hope their hosts depart pining for Glenn Murray.

1259	Liverpool	Bournemouth	3	0	14/04/2018	18	The Champions League semi-final dominates Liverpool’s thoughts but Jürgen Klopp wants a top-four finish in the Premier League secured as quickly as possible. Mohamed Salah requires one more league goal to reach 30 for the season, and has scored 11 times in his last six matches at Anfield, but his game-time may be restricted against Bournemouth after he returned from a groin problem to play a starring role in the midweek European defeat of Manchester City. Liverpool need three more goals to record 300 in all competitions under Klopp. Andy Hunter	1	-0.310766339302063,0.9976814985275269
1260	Southampton	Chelsea	2	3	14/04/2018	18	In the corresponding fixture last season, Diego Costa sealed a hard-fought win that showed Chelsea’s title credentials to end Southampton’s long unbeaten run at home. That was only 18 months ago. Both teams have unravelled this season and head into a league and cup double-header wondering where another defeat will leave them. Southampton’s plight is more pressing and with five tricky-looking fixtures to follow, Mark Hughes must aim for better than the narrow defeat to Arsenal. He will be without the suspended Jack Stephens but at least has in-form strikers to choose from – Charlie Austin and Shane Long both scored at the Emirates, with Long expected to recover from an ankle problem.

1261	Swansea City	Everton	1	1	14/04/2018	18	A huge game for Swansea, who could take a significant step towards survival if they can rack up a fifth successive home win. Jordan Ayew, Swansea’s leading goalscorer, returns from suspension and will go straight back into the team, possibly at the expense of Tammy Abraham. For Everton, Wayne Rooney is expected to start, with Sam Allardyce insisting there is no problem between them after he substituted the forward last weekend, but there will be no Liberty Stadium return for Gylfi Sigurdsson, who remains injured.

Still, second place is definitely on for José Mourinho’s men and that would represent a four-place leap from last season. Jamie Jackson	-1	0.008734256029129028,0.5094658136367798

Roy Hodson’s side will draw level with them, and take a huge step towards safety, if they do. Hodgson should be confident after Palace flourished in attack to beat Brighton last week. Four Watford players may miss out with a stomach virus too. Javi Gracia has not named two of the ill players which suggests he is not feeling confident about his side’s chances.

1267	West Brom	Liverpool	2	2	21/04/2018	18	Can West Brom cause another upset? With Jürgen Klopp surely focused on Roma at Anfield on Tuesday and Champions League football next season all but secured, it is a possibility. However it does feel like rather a large stretch of the imagination for the bumbling Baggies to best Liverpool despite needing to win to maintain their already incredibly slender hopes of staying up. Mohamed Salah alone has scored more league goals this season than Darren Moore’s side. Graham Searles	0	0.009280800819396973,0.9987138509750366
1268	Arsenal	West Ham United	4	1	22/04/2018	18	Arsène Wenger’s farewell to Arsenal begins against West Ham. A first opportunity for the fans to show just how much he has meant to the club over the past 22 years before the pressure of hosting Atlético Madrid on Thursday. What influence, if any, could the news of Wenger’s departure have on his side? The Emirates faithful will be hoping to be transported back to the glory days but West Ham are not safe yet. Survival instincts may prevail on Sunday. Graham Searles	1	0.007891133427619934,0
1269	Manchester City	Swansea City	5	0	22/04/2018	18	Manchester City will stride out before their adoring crowd as freshly-crowned champions knowing five wins from the final five matches will take them to 102 points and eclipse Chelsea’s record Premier League tally of 95. Pep Guardiola, though, will look to see how his charges react to their new status so, while Swansea will expect a long afternoon, as they are fighting relegation, Carlos Carvalhal’s side may not be a walkover. Jamie Jackson	1	0.9996007084846497,0.9913520812988281
1270	Stoke City	Burnley	1	1	22/04/2018	18	Stoke have left it very late to start a surge for safety, and if it does not begin against Burnley, it will probably not materialise at all. Scoring has been a problem for Stoke all season so they will have taken some encouragement from the fact that Burnley looked uncharacteristically leaky while losing 2-1 to Chelsea on Thursday. Then again, Stoke are no Chelsea. Paul Doyle	0	-0.9941365122795105,0
1271	Everton	Newcastle United	1	0	23/04/2018	18	Rafael Benítez’s in-form Newcastle can leapfrog Everton with a fifth consecutive league victory. The onus will be on Jonjo Shelvey to show the watching Gareth Southgate that he is worth considering, and trusting, for a late inclusion in England’s World Cup squad. For Sam Allardyce, the visit of his former club brings reminders of an unhappy spell at St James’ Park and a massive pay-off. With Evertonians calling for something similar at Swansea last weekend, albeit in harsher terms, he could do with another home win to keep the restless supporters at bay. Andy Hunter	1	-0.9376749396324158,0.9952477018038431
1272	Burnley	Brighton	0	0	28/04/2018	18	Burnley’s dream of playing in the Europa League is still alive despite the fact they have fallen short in consecutive Premier League games. Sean Dyche’s side have suffered just one defeat from their past eight games, and will prove to be a difficult task for a Brighton side who have struggled away from home this season. Chris Hughton’s men are winless since their back-to-back successes against Swansea and Arsenal in early March. Joel Aberg	0	0.9989737272262573,-0.2963294784228007
1273	Crystal Palace	Leicester City	5	0	28/04/2018	18	Victory against Leicester City would hoist Crystal Palace to 38 points and the verge of top-flight safety. Claude Puel’s side will arrive at Selhurst Park having won only twice in 10 league games stretching back to January, without Kasper Schmeichel, and with the manager’s job beyond this season in doubt. Yet Roy Hodgson is still preaching caution in a bid to ward off any complacency. Palace, much improved, have lost only once to a side outside the top eight since September and must determine whether the time is apt to recall Christian Benteke. Dominic Fifield	1	-0.9499605496724447,0.9542468786239624
1274	Huddersfield	Everton	0	2	28/04/2018	18	Everton, following their win against in-form Newcastle, travel to Huddersfield and are eyeing a second successive win. David Wagner’s side, six points above the relegation zone, have taken 25 from a maximum 35 points at home this season, in comparison to Everton’s 12 from 45 on the road. Gylfi Sigurdsson is back in light training, but the Everton manager, Sam Allardyce, said the Iceland international is still “a way off” making a first-team return anytime soon. Joel Aberg	-1	0.9894492328166962,0.03718927502632141
1275	Liverpool	Stoke City	0	0	28/04/2018	18	Paul Lambert has overseen three wins at Liverpool in his managerial career, the most recent with Wolves in the FA Cup last season, but now must accomplish what no other Stoke manager in history has done to bring hope to the club’s relegation fight. Stoke have never won a top flight league game at Anfield and Jürgen Klopp’s side are unbeaten at home in the Premier League this season. The Liverpool manager must rotate before next week’s second leg against Roma and the visitors simply have to capitalise with only three matches of their season remaining. Andy Hunter	0	-0.9994333386421204,0
1276	Newcastle United	West Brom	0	1	28/04/2018	18	Darren Moore has presided over the collection of five points from three games since assuming caretaker charge of West Brom but he could still see his side’s long inevitable relegation confirmed on Saturday night. Meanwhile Rafa Benítez has announced that talks over his future on Tyneside are under way. Newcastle’s manager has only a year left on his contract and will want assurances as to the summer transfer budget before extending it. “We’ve had conversations and we’ll have more conversations next week,” said Benítez before stressing that a quick resolution would be “better for everybody”.

1277	Southampton	Bournemouth	2	1	28/04/2018	18	Southampton’s situation remains dire but there is still a potential escape route open to Mark Hughes’s side. With matches against Everton and relegation rivals Swansea following this, they have the chance to make up ground before the final-day visit of Manchester City. Hughes will be without playmaker Sofiane Boufal – he is training with the youth team after falling out with the manager. Eddie Howe will still be unable to call upon Adam Smith, who is close to a return, as his visiting side look to assert their south-coast supremacy. Niall McVeigh	1	-0.019695013761520386,-0.8538520336151123
1278	Swansea City	Chelsea	0	1	28/04/2018	18	There is plenty at stake for both clubs as Chelsea pursue the three points that would keep alive hopes of a top-four finish while Swansea chase the victory that would give their survival prospects a huge boost. Swansea have collected 13 points from their past five home games, beating Liverpool and Arsenal in the process, but they have injury problems at the back, with Federico Fernández and Kyle Bartley doubtful. Chelsea, who are looking for a third successive away win in the league, are still without the suspended Marcos Alonso. Stuart James	-1	-0.992961585521698,0.9845298528671265
1279	Manchester United	Arsenal	2	1	29/04/2018	18	Relations between José Mourinho and Arsène Wenger have eased recently yet how Manchester United fans might greet the Arsenal manager, for so long their bete noire, as he walks out at Old Trafford will intrigue, given the Frenchman is leaving the Gunners. On the pitch United will hope to claim another win in the bid for second place: Arsenal, of course, want to prevent that. Jamie Jackson	1	0.989624559879303,0
1280	West Ham United	Manchester City	1	4	29/04/2018	18	Another victory will move Manchester City one win away from setting a new points record in the Premier League. The champions look determined to keep standards high and they scored nine goals in two visits to the London Stadium last season. They will fancy their chances against West Ham, who are still not safe from relegation after last weekend’s thrashing at Arsenal. David Moyes’s team will require a perfect defensive performance to stand any chance of denying City. Jacob Steinberg	-1	0.9987683892250061,0.3482212821642558
1281	Tottenham Hotspur	Watford	2	0	30/04/2018	18	Tottenham, devastated by their FA Cup semi-final defeat against Manchester United last week, must bounce back to maintain their advantage over Chelsea chasing in fifth place, who on Monday may be two points behind Spurs, by taking all three against out-out-form Watford. Javi Gracia’s side, winless since the beginning of March, are struggling with injuries. Troy Deeney and Roberto Pereyra are both major doubts for the trip to Wembley. Joel Aberg	1	0.9878950119018555,-0.3066599766413371
1282	Bournemouth	Swansea City	1	0	05/05/2018	18	Swansea are in trouble. Carlos Carvalhal’s side are just a point above the relegation zone and crucially their momentum disappeared. Bournemouth should have a chance at turning their own abject streak around as Swansea have scored just two goals and are winless in their past seven games in all competitions. Carvalhal will be counting on fear of the dreaded drop to provide all the motivation his side need to keep their heads above water. Graham Searles	1	0.9978845715522766,-0.9951764345169067
1283	Everton	Southampton	1	1	05/05/2018	18	Southampton have three games to save their skins and leaving aside Tuesday’s trip to Swansea for a six-pointer, this is the other one in which they really need a return as they host Manchester City on the final day and that may be too tall an order. Last week’s win against Bournemouth was only their second in 10 league games but it gave the fans hope and Mark Hughes will be looking to capitalise on that during the trip to Goodison, where the atmosphere has been eerily quiet of late. Sam Allardyce, like Hughes another merry-go-round perennial to take over in the dugout since Saints defeated Everton 4-1 in October’s reverse fixture, reckons he has won “the hearts and minds” of the Everton majority with their home performances and insists the dissenters are a vocal minority. Some were evident when Everton won their last home game, against Newcastle, with their only shot on target, but many were more so during the 2-0 win at Huddersfield later that week. With Allardyce already talking about his plans for the close season, some may even welcome the chance to clear their throats and get the banners out if Hughes produces the away win Saints crave.

1284	Leicester City	West Ham United	0	2	05/05/2018	18	If there was ever a good time for West Ham to be travelling to the King Power Stadium, then this is surely it. Leicester have won only four of their previous 18 league games, they were booed off in the last home match and go into this fixture off the back of a 5-0 defeat at Crystal Palace with a long injury list. It has not exactly been plain-sailing lately for West Ham either but Andy Carroll is set to be involved after patching up his differences with David Moyes. Stuart James	-1	0.04248914122581482,0.009689658880233765
1285	Stoke City	Crystal Palace	1	2	05/05/2018	18	It is do or die time for Stoke. A fourth successive draw would not be enough: Paul Lambert’s side must win this match if they are to have any chance of going into their final match of the campaign with survival still possible. Crystal Palace, though technically not safe yet, arrive in buoyant mood thanks to last week’s thrashing of Leicester. Paul Doyle	-1	0.9696972370147705,0.9995821118354797
1286	Watford	Newcastle United	2	1	05/05/2018	18	Watford facing Newcastle is certainly not the most tantalising fixture of the weekend but there is still intrigue regarding the future of the respective managers. Javi Gracia has the potential to guide Watford to their best Premier League finish, as they sit level with their previous record in 13th, but their run of seven matches without a win will not have pleased the trigger-happy powers that be. Rafa Benítez has hinted, again, that he is prepared to move on if his masterful season is not rewarded with investment in the squad. Graham Searles	1	0.36068397760391235,-0.9893472194671631
1287	West Brom	Tottenham Hotspur	1	0	05/05/2018	18	West Brom have to win against Tottenham and if successful they must rely on Swansea losing again to avoid relegation for another week. This feels highly unlikely, despite Darren Moore’s positive influence on the Baggies, as West Brom last beat Tottenham at the Hawthorns in 2008. Maurico Pochettino’s side are yet to secure a place in the Champions League next season and will be hungry to edge even closer to another crack at Europe’s elite with victory. Graham Searles	1	-0.9776820540428162,0.9845466017723083
1288	Arsenal	Burnley	5	0	06/05/2018	18	This is the big one in terms of Arsène Wenger’s farewell – his final home game and Arsenal have lots planned, including ‘Merci Arsène’ T-shirts for the fans. Burnley will not play the obliging guests. Were they to win, they could end up finishing sixth and squeezing Arsenal into seventh. Both clubs would enter the Europa League but Arsenal would begin in a qualifier on 26 July – currently the date of their first pre-season friendly against Atlético Madrid in Singapore. David Hytner	1	0.9609211484591166,-0.9988335967063904
1289	Chelsea	Liverpool	1	0	06/05/2018	18	Liverpool will arrive on a high with thoughts already fixed on the Champions League final later this month, but Chelsea could technically draw level on points with the team currently third should they win their next two fixtures. Antonio Conte’s side are clinging to the remote possibility of a top four finish, though the Italian did say Sunday’s game “could be a good opportunity to keep the hope alive”. They have belatedly found some form of sorts, with four wins in a row in all competitions. Liverpool can ill afford to be distracted. Dominic Fifield	1	0.8995910882949829,-0.04312315583229065
1290	Burnley	Bournemouth	1	2	13/05/2018	18	Burnley are looking for their first win in five matches, against Bournemouth, but no one really cares about that at Turf Moor. Three points to see out a memorable season would be nice, but Burnley already have a hugely impressive 54 and have put themselves into Europe for the first time since 1967. No one was expecting that, though as a result Burnley will be expecting interest in Sean Dyche to resurface again over summer. “It’s the price of success,” chairman Mike Garlick said. Paul Wilson	-1	0.2951050400733948,0
1291	Crystal Palace	West Brom	2	0	13/05/2018	18	Two of the division’s form teams meet on the final day, with the occasion little more than a celebration of the two managers. Roy Hodgson’s feat in steering Crystal Palace to safety, despite a chronic injury crisis, having been pointless in mid-October has been remarkable. Darren Moore, even only in his capacity as a caretaker, has mustered 11 points from five matches, claimed the manager of the month award for April and endured relegation on Tuesday. The hope – and it is only a hope as yet – is he is given a chance to take up the reins on a permanent basis. Dominic Fifield	1	0.9996730089187622,0
1292	Liverpool	Brighton	4	0	13/05/2018	18	Complaints over Liverpool’s recent league form have been excessive, given the limited midfield and forward options available to Jürgen Klopp while guiding the club into the Champions League final, but the last day equation is straight-forward on many levels. Preserve an unbeaten home campaign against a Brighton team that has won twice on the road all season and Liverpool are in the Champions League for a second year running. As a side note, Mohamed Salah needs one more goal to become Liverpool’s record scorer in a Premier League campaign. He is currently level with Luis Suárez’s 31 goals in 2013-14. Andy Hunter	1	0.33354928096135456,0.9996480941772461
1293	Manchester United	Watford	1	0	13/05/2018	18	Manchester United’s odd league campaign will have them end in second place whatever the result versus Watford despite José Mourinho’s side rarely exciting or convincing. The visitors arrive safe in 13th and could end as high as 10th should they beat United and, given West Brom’s victory at Old Trafford in April, they may fancy their chances. Jamie Jackson	1	-0.000351637601852417,0
1294	Newcastle United	Chelsea	3	0	13/05/2018	18	The consensus suggests this will be Antonio Conte’s last Premier League game in charge of Chelsea. Can he use it to somehow secure a top-four finish? Newcastle fans must trust this is not Rafael Benítez’s Tyneside swansong. The negotiations between their widely coveted manager and Mike Ashley over extending a contract that has only a year to run remain delicate. Expect the Gallowgate End to, not for the first time, repeatedly sing “Rafa Benítez, we want you to stay.” Chelsea meanwhile are monitoring Newcastle’s much improved centre-half Jamaal Lascelles. He could be key to Benítez’s team ending a run of four straight defeats as they struggle to retain their grip on 10th place. Louise Taylor	1	-0.9842156916856766,0.9160513877868652
1295	Southampton	Manchester City	0	1	13/05/2018	18	Manchester City’s quest for 100 points come up against a Southampton side who are all but safe but technically still need a draw, after four away points in a week and with a 10-goal swing required if Swansea finally manage a win. Mark Hughes would give his prospects of staying an added boost with a return against the club who sacked him in 2009 and he has urged Saints to make a quick decision for next season. “It’s a well-run club, good club, and a good opportunity for whoever gets it,” said Hughes who arrived only in March. If City win they will set more records, however, for the most away wins in a Premier League season with 16, and the most points on the road, 50. “In the last few weeks these numbers have helped us keep focus,” said Guardiola, whose players secured the title on 15 April. Mark Tallentire	-1	0.9962852895259857,0.3730456630388896
1296	Swansea City	Stoke City	1	2	13/05/2018	18	A match many thought would have so much riding on it a few weeks ago is now effectively a dead rubber. Stoke are already condemned to the Championship and Swansea’s relegation will be confirmed at the final whistle. It promises to be a strange day, with Swansea fans planning to hold protests to vent their anger at the board and also turning up to say farewell to Àngel Rangel and Leon Britton, two club stalwarts. Stoke, like Swansea, will be glad when it is all over. Stuart James	-1	0.9779690504074097,0.005281955003738403
1297	West Ham United	Everton	3	1	13/05/2018	18	David Moyes and Sam Allardyce face their former employers knowing that they could both be out of a job soon. Wayne Rooney, who has received an offer from DC United, is unlikely to feature because of a knee injury, so fans may have missed their chance to pay tribute to a legend. Moyes and Allardyce, on the other hand, are unlikely to be mourned if they are shown the door by West Ham and Everton respectively. Jacob Steinberg	1	0,-0.24474820494651794
